### ktorrent vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 7.04
* Ubuntu 6.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Details

USN-436-1 fixed a vulnerability in KTorrent. The original fix for path traversal was incomplete, allowing for alternate vectors of attack. This update solves the problem.

Original advisory details:

 Bryan Burns of Juniper Networks discovered that KTorrent did not correctly validate the destination file paths nor the HAVE statements sent by torrent peers. A malicious remote peer could send specially crafted messages to overwrite files or execute arbitrary code with user privileges.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 7.04
 : ktorrent <span>2.1-0ubuntu2.1</span>

Ubuntu 6.10
 : ktorrent <span>2.0.3+dfsg1-0ubuntu1.2</span>

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : ktorrent <span>1.2-0ubuntu5.2</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart KTorrent to effect the necessary changes.
