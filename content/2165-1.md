description: |
    Neel Mehta discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory in the TLS heartbeat extension. An attacker could use this issue to obtain up to 64k of memory contents from the client or server, possibly leading to the disclosure of private keys and other sensitive information.

### openssl vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 13.10
* Ubuntu 12.10
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

OpenSSL could be made to expose sensitive information over the network, possibly including private keys.

### Software description

* openssl 

### Details

Neel Mehta discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory in the TLS heartbeat extension. An attacker could use this issue to obtain up to 64k of memory contents from the client or server, possibly leading to the disclosure of private keys and other sensitive information. ([CVE-2014-0160](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-0160))

Yuval Yarom and Naomi Benger discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled timing during swap operations in the Montgomery ladder implementation. An attacker could use this issue to perform side-channel attacks and possibly recover ECDSA nonces. ([CVE-2014-0076](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-0076)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 13.10
 : [libssl1.0.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl) <span> [1.0.1e-3ubuntu1.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/1.0.1e-3ubuntu1.2) </span> 

Ubuntu 12.10
 : [libssl1.0.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl) <span> [1.0.1c-3ubuntu2.7](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/1.0.1c-3ubuntu2.7) </span> 

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [libssl1.0.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl) <span> [1.0.1-4ubuntu5.12](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/1.0.1-4ubuntu5.12) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes. Since this issue may have resulted in compromised private keys, it is recommended to regenerate them.
