### oxide-qt vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.10
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Oxide. 

### Software description

* oxide-qt 

### Details

A use-after-free bug was discovered in the DOM implementation in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1209](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1209))

It was discovered that V8 did not properly consider frame access restrictions when throwing exceptions in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2015-1210](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1210))

It was discovered that Chromium did not properly restrict the URI scheme during ServiceWorker registration. If a user were tricked in to downloading and opening a specially crafted HTML file, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass security restrictions. ([CVE-2015-1211](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1211))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1212](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1212))
