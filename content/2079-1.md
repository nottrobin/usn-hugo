### Details

Anton Johansson discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain invalid TLS handshakes. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-4353](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4353))

Ron Barber discovered that OpenSSL used an incorrect data structure to obtain a version number. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-6449](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-6449))

Dmitry Sobinov discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain DTLS retransmissions. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-6450](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-6450))

This update also disables the default use of the RdRand feature of certain Intel CPUs as the sole source of entropy.
