    It was discovered that Quagga incorrectly handled certain Outbound Route Filtering (ORF) records. A remote authenticated attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code. The default compiler options for Ubuntu 8.04 LTS and later should reduce the vulnerability to a denial of service. ([CVE-2010-2948](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2948))
