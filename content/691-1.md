### ruby1.9 vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.10

### Software description

* ruby1.9 

### Details

Laurent Gaffie discovered that Ruby did not properly check for memory allocation failures. If a user or automated system were tricked into running a malicious script, an attacker could cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-3443](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3443))

This update also fixes a regression in the upstream patch previously applied to fix [CVE-2008-3790](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3790). The regression would cause parsing of some XML documents to fail.
