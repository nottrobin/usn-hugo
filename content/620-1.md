    It was discovered that OpenSSL was vulnerable to a double-free when using TLS server extensions. A remote attacker could send a crafted packet and cause a denial of service via application crash in applications linked against OpenSSL. Ubuntu 8.04 LTS does not compile TLS server extensions by default. ([CVE-2008-0891](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0891))

### openssl vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Software description

* openssl 

### Details

It was discovered that OpenSSL was vulnerable to a double-free when using TLS server extensions. A remote attacker could send a crafted packet and cause a denial of service via application crash in applications linked against OpenSSL. Ubuntu 8.04 LTS does not compile TLS server extensions by default. ([CVE-2008-0891](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0891))

It was discovered that OpenSSL could dereference a NULL pointer. If a user or automated system were tricked into connecting to a malicious server with particular cipher suites, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash. ([CVE-2008-1672](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-1672)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
 : [libssl0.9.8](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl) <span> [0.9.8g-4ubuntu3.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/0.9.8g-4ubuntu3.3) </span>
