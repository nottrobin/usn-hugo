### python-django vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.10
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 9.10

### Summary

Attackers could use Django to perform web-based attacks. 

### Software description

* python-django 

### Details

It was discovered that Django did not properly validate HTTP requests that contain an X-Requested-With header. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. ([CVE-2011-0696](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0696))

It was discovered that Django did not properly sanitize its input when performing file uploads, resulting in cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing server output during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2011-0697](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0697)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.10
 : [python-django](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-django) <span> [1.2.3-1ubuntu0.2.10.10.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-django/1.2.3-1ubuntu0.2.10.10.2) </span> 

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [python-django](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-django) <span> [1.1.1-2ubuntu1.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-django/1.1.1-2ubuntu1.3) </span> 

Ubuntu 9.10
 : [python-django](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-django) <span> [1.1.1-1ubuntu1.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python-django/1.1.1-1ubuntu1.2) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

ATTENTION: This update introduces a small backwards-imcompatible change to perform full CSRF validation on all requests. Prior to this update, AJAX requests were excepted from CSRF protections. For more details, please see http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.2/releases/1.2.5/.

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
