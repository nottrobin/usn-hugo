### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

 An flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s perf_events interface. A local user could exploit this flaw to escalate privileges on the system. ([CVE-2013-2094](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2094))

Andy Lutomirski discover an error in the Linux kernel&#39;s credential handling on unix sockets. A local user could exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-1979](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1979))

A buffer overflow vulnerability was discovered in the Broadcom tg3 ethernet driver for the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash the system) or potentially escalate privileges on the system. ([CVE-2013-1929](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1929))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s tkill and tgkill system calls when used from compat processes. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially sensitive kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2141](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2141))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s ftrace subsystem interface. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-3301](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-3301)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-1432-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [3.2.0-1432.41](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1432.41) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
