    USN-30-1 fixed several flaws in the Linux ELF binary loader&#39;s handling of setuid binaries. Unfortunately it was found that these patches were not sufficient to prevent all possible attacks on 64-bit platforms, so previous amd64 kernel images were still vulnerable to root privilege escalation if setuid binaries were run under certain conditions.
