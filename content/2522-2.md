Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that ICU incorrectly handled memory operations when processing fonts. If an application using ICU processed crafted data, an attacker could cause it to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.
