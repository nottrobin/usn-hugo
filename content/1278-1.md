### linux-lts-backport-maverick vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-backport-maverick 

### Details

It was discovered that CIFS incorrectly handled authentication. When a user had a CIFS share mounted that required authentication, a local user could mount the same share without knowing the correct password. ([CVE-2011-1585](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1585))

Andrea Righi discovered a race condition in the KSM memory merging support. If KSM was being used, a local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2183](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2183))

Vasily Averin discovered that the NFS Lock Manager (NLM) incorrectly handled unlock requests. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2491](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2491))

Robert Swiecki discovered that mapping extensions were incorrectly handled. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2496](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2496))

It was discovered that the wireless stack incorrectly verified SSID lengths. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service or gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-2517](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2517)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-2.6.35-31-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-maverick) <span> [2.6.35-31.62~lucid1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-maverick/2.6.35-31.62~lucid1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-2.6.35-31-server](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-maverick) <span> [2.6.35-31.62~lucid1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-maverick/2.6.35-31.62~lucid1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-2.6.35-31-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-maverick) <span> [2.6.35-31.62~lucid1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-maverick/2.6.35-31.62~lucid1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-2.6.35-31-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-maverick) <span> [2.6.35-31.62~lucid1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-maverick/2.6.35-31.62~lucid1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
