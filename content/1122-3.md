### thunderbird regression

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.04

### Summary

An empty menu bar sometimes appeared after upgrade in USN-1122-2 

### Software description

* thunderbird 

### Details

USN-1122-2 fixed vulnerabilities in Thunderbird on Ubuntu 11.04. A regression was introduced which caused Thunderbird to display an empty menu bar. This update fixes the problem. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that there was a vulnerability in the memory handling of certain types of content. An attacker could exploit this to possibly run arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird. ([CVE-2011-1202](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0081">CVE-2011-0081</a>) It was discovered that Thunderbird incorrectly handled certain JavaScript requests. If JavaScript were enabled, an attacker could exploit this to possibly run arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0069">CVE-2011-0069</a>) Ian Beer discovered a vulnerability in the memory handling of a certain types of documents. An attacker could exploit this to possibly run arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0070">CVE-2011-0070</a>) Bob Clary, Henri Sivonen, Marco Bonardo, Mats Palmgren and Jesse Ruderman discovered several memory vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these to possibly run arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0080">CVE-2011-0080</a>) Aki Helin discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the HTML rendering code. An attacker could exploit these to possibly run arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0074">CVE-2011-0074</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0075">CVE-2011-0075</a>) Ian Beer discovered multiple overflow vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these to possibly run arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0077">CVE-2011-0077</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0078">CVE-2011-0078</a>) Martin Barbella discovered a memory vulnerability in the handling of certain DOM elements. An attacker could exploit this to possibly run arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0072">CVE-2011-0072</a>) It was discovered that there were use-after-free vulnerabilities in Thunderbird&#39;s mChannel and mObserverList objects. An attacker could exploit these to possibly run arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0065">CVE-2011-0065</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0066">CVE-2011-0066</a>) It was discovered that there was a vulnerability in the handling of the nsTreeSelection element. An attacker sending a specially crafted E-Mail could exploit this to possibly run arbitrary code as the user running Thunderbird. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0073">CVE-2011-0073</a>) Paul Stone discovered a vulnerability in the handling of Java applets. If plugins were enabled, an attacker could use this to mimic interaction with form autocomplete controls and steal entries from the form history. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0067">CVE-2011-0067</a>) Soroush Dalili discovered a vulnerability in the resource: protocol. This could potentially allow an attacker to load arbitrary files that were accessible to the user running Thunderbird. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0071">CVE-2011-0071</a>) Chris Evans discovered a vulnerability in Thunderbird&#39;s XSLT generate-id() function. An attacker could possibly use this vulnerability to make other attacks more reliable. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1202)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 11.04
 : [thunderbird-globalmenu](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/thunderbird) <span> [3.1.10+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.11.04.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/thunderbird/3.1.10+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.11.04.2) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to restart Thunderbird to make all the necessary changes.
