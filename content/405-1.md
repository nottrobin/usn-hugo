### fetchmail vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
* Ubuntu 5.10

### Details

It was discovered that fetchmail did not correctly require TLS negotiation in certain situations. This would result in a user&#39;s unencrypted password being sent across the network.

If fetchmail has been configured to use the &quot;sslproto tls1&quot;, &quot;sslcertck&quot;, or &quot;sslfingerprint&quot; options with a server that does not correctly support TLS negotiation, this update may cause fetchmail to (correctly) abort authentication.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 6.10
 : fetchmail <span>6.3.4-1ubuntu4.1</span>

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : fetchmail <span>6.3.2-2ubuntu2.1</span>

Ubuntu 5.10
 : fetchmail <span>6.2.5-13ubuntu3.3</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the necessary changes.
