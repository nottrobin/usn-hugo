    Alexandre Martani discovered that the APT daily cron script did not check the return code of the date command. If a machine is configured for automatic updates and is in a time zone where DST occurs at midnight, under certain circumstances automatic updates might not be applied and could become permanently disabled.

### apt vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* apt 

### Details

Alexandre Martani discovered that the APT daily cron script did not check the return code of the date command. If a machine is configured for automatic updates and is in a time zone where DST occurs at midnight, under certain circumstances automatic updates might not be applied and could become permanently disabled. ([CVE-2009-1300](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1300))

Michael Casadevall discovered that APT did not properly verify repositories signed with a revoked or expired key. If a repository were signed with only an expired or revoked key and the signature was otherwise valid, APT would consider the repository valid. (https://launchpad.net/bugs/356012)
