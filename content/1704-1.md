### linux-lts-quantal - Linux kernel hardware enablement from Quantal vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-quantal 

### Details

 Brad Spengler discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s uname system call. An unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to read kernel stack memory. ([CVE-2012-0957](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0957))

Jon Howell reported a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s KVM (Kernel-based virtual machine) subsystem&#39;s handling of the XSAVE feature. On hosts, using qemu userspace, without the XSAVE feature an unprivileged local attacker could exploit this flaw to crash the system. ([CVE-2012-4461](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4461))

Dmitry Monakhov reported a race condition flaw the Linux ext4 filesystem that can expose stale data. An unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause an information leak. ([CVE-2012-4508](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4508))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s handling of script execution when module loading is enabled. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a leak of kernel stack contents. ([CVE-2012-4530](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4530))

Rodrigo Freire discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s TCP illinois congestion control algorithm. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-4565](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4565))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s handling of new hot-plugged memory. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service by crashing the system. ([CVE-2012-5517](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5517))

Florian Weimer discovered that hypervkvpd, which is distributed in the Linux kernel, was not correctly validating source addresses of netlink packets. An untrusted local user can cause a denial of service by causing hypervkvpd to exit. ([CVE-2012-5532](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5532))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s /dev/dvb device. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from the kernel&#39;s stack memory. ([CVE-2013-1928](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1928)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-22-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-quantal) <span> [3.5.0-22.34~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-quantal/3.5.0-22.34~precise1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.
