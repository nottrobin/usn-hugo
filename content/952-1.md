    Adrian Pastor and Tim Starling discovered that the CUPS web interface incorrectly protected against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. If an authenticated user were tricked into visiting a malicious website while logged into CUPS, a remote attacker could modify the CUPS configuration and possibly steal confidential data.

### cups, cupsys vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 9.10
* Ubuntu 9.04
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* cups 

* cupsys 

### Details

Adrian Pastor and Tim Starling discovered that the CUPS web interface incorrectly protected against cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. If an authenticated user were tricked into visiting a malicious website while logged into CUPS, a remote attacker could modify the CUPS configuration and possibly steal confidential data. ([CVE-2010-0540](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-0540))

It was discovered that CUPS did not properly handle memory allocations in the texttops filter. If a user or automated system were tricked into printing a crafted text file, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with privileges of the CUPS user (lp). ([CVE-2010-0542](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-0542))

Luca Carettoni discovered that the CUPS web interface incorrectly handled form variables. A remote attacker who had access to the CUPS web interface could use this flaw to read a limited amount of memory from the cupsd process and possibly obtain confidential data. ([CVE-2010-1748](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1748))
