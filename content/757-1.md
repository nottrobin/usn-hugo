    It was discovered that Ghostscript contained a buffer underflow in its CCITTFax decoding filter. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted PDF file, an attacker could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code with privileges of the user invoking the program.

### ghostscript, gs-esp, gs-gpl vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* ghostscript 

* gs-esp 

* gs-gpl 

### Details

It was discovered that Ghostscript contained a buffer underflow in its CCITTFax decoding filter. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted PDF file, an attacker could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code with privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2007-6725](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-6725))

It was discovered that Ghostscript contained a buffer overflow in the BaseFont writer module. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted Postscript file, an attacker could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code with privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-6679](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-6679))

It was discovered that Ghostscript contained additional integer overflows in its ICC color management library. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted Postscript or PDF file, an attacker could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code with privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-0792](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0792))

Alin Rad Pop discovered that Ghostscript contained a buffer overflow in the jbig2dec library. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted PDF file, an attacker could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code with privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-0196](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0196))

USN-743-1 provided updated ghostscript and gs-gpl packages to fix two security vulnerabilities. This update corrects the same vulnerabilities in the gs-esp package.

Original advisory details: It was discovered that Ghostscript contained multiple integer overflows in its ICC color management library. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted Postscript file, an attacker could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code with privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-0583](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0583))

 It was discovered that Ghostscript did not properly perform bounds checking in its ICC color management library. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted Postscript file, an attacker could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code with privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-0584](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0584)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:
