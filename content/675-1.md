### pidgin vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 7.10

### Software description

* pidgin 

### Details

It was discovered that Pidgin did not properly handle certain malformed messages in the MSN protocol handler. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted message and possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-2927](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2927))

It was discovered that Pidgin did not properly handle file transfers containing a long filename and special characters in the MSN protocol handler. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted filename in a file transfer request and cause Pidgin to crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-2955](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2955))

It was discovered that Pidgin did not impose resource limitations in the UPnP service. A remote attacker could cause Pidgin to download arbitrary files and cause a denial of service from memory or disk space exhaustion. ([CVE-2008-2957](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2957))

It was discovered that Pidgin did not validate SSL certificates when using a secure connection. If a remote attacker were able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive information. This update alters Pidgin behaviour by asking users to confirm the validity of a certificate upon initial login. ([CVE-2008-3532](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3532)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
 : [pidgin](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pidgin) <span> [1:2.4.1-1ubuntu2.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pidgin/1:2.4.1-1ubuntu2.2) </span> 

Ubuntu 7.10
 : [pidgin](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pidgin) <span> [1:2.2.1-1ubuntu4.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pidgin/1:2.2.1-1ubuntu4.3) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Pidgin to effect the necessary changes.
