* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 7.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* mozilla-thunderbird 

* thunderbird 

### Details

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine. If Javascript were enabled, an attacker could exploit these flaws to crash Thunderbird and possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2009-0352](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0352))

Jesse Ruderman and Gary Kwong discovered flaws in the browser engine. If a user had Javascript enabled, these problems could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-0774](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0772">CVE-2009-0772</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0774))

Georgi Guninski discovered a flaw when Thunderbird performed a cross-domain redirect. If a user had Javascript enabled, an attacker could bypass the same-origin policy in Thunderbird by utilizing nsIRDFService and steal private data from users authenticated to the redirected website. ([CVE-2009-0776](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0776))
