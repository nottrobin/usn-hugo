### openssl vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 15.04
* Ubuntu 14.10
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in OpenSSL. 

### Software description

* openssl 

### Details

Praveen Kariyanahalli, Ivan Fratric and Felix Groebert discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when buffering DTLS data. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-8176](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8176))

Joseph Barr-Pixton discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled malformed ECParameters structures. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to hang, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-1788](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1788))

Robert Swiecki and Hanno Böck discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain ASN1_TIME strings. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-1789](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1789))

Michal Zalewski discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled missing content when parsing ASN.1-encoded PKCS#7 blobs. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-1790](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1790))

Emilia Käsper discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled NewSessionTicket when being used by a multi-threaded client. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-1791](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1791))

Johannes Bauer discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled verifying signedData messages using the CMS code. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to hang, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-1792](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1792))

As a security improvement, this update also modifies OpenSSL behaviour to reject DH key sizes below 768 bits, preventing a possible downgrade attack. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 15.04
 : [libssl1.0.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl) <span> [1.0.1f-1ubuntu11.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/1.0.1f-1ubuntu11.4) </span> 

Ubuntu 14.10
 : [libssl1.0.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl) <span> [1.0.1f-1ubuntu9.8](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/1.0.1f-1ubuntu9.8) </span> 

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 : [libssl1.0.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl) <span> [1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.15](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.15) </span> 

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [libssl1.0.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl) <span> [1.0.1-4ubuntu5.31](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/1.0.1-4ubuntu5.31) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.
