    Dan Kaminsky discovered that SSL certificates signed with MD2 could be spoofed given enough time.  As a result, an attacker could potentially create a malicious trusted certificate to impersonate another site. This update handles this issue by completely disabling MD2 for certificate validation in OpenJDK. ([CVE-2009-2409](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-2409))

### openjdk-6 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 9.10
* Ubuntu 9.04
* Ubuntu 8.10

### Software description

* openjdk-6 

### Details

Dan Kaminsky discovered that SSL certificates signed with MD2 could be spoofed given enough time. As a result, an attacker could potentially create a malicious trusted certificate to impersonate another site. This update handles this issue by completely disabling MD2 for certificate validation in OpenJDK. ([CVE-2009-2409](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-2409))

It was discovered that ICC profiles could be identified with &quot;..&quot; pathnames. If a user were tricked into running a specially crafted applet, a remote attacker could gain information about a local system. ([CVE-2009-3728](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3728))

Peter Vreugdenhil discovered multiple flaws in the processing of graphics in the AWT library. If a user were tricked into running a specially crafted applet, a remote attacker could crash the application or run arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2009-3871](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3869">CVE-2009-3869</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3871))

Multiple flaws were discovered in JPEG and BMP image handling. If a user were tricked into loading a specially crafted image, a remote attacker could crash the application or run arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2009-3885](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3873">CVE-2009-3873</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3874">CVE-2009-3874</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3885))

Coda Hale discovered that HMAC-based signatures were not correctly validated. Remote attackers could bypass certain forms of authentication, granting unexpected access. ([CVE-2009-3875](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3875))

Multiple flaws were discovered in ASN.1 parsing. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted HTTP stream that would exhaust system memory and lead to a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-3877](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3876">CVE-2009-3876</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3877))

It was discovered that the graphics configuration subsystem did not correctly handle arrays. If a user were tricked into running a specially crafted applet, a remote attacker could exploit this to crash the application or execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2009-3879](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3879))

It was discovered that loggers and Swing did not correctly handle certain sensitive objects. If a user were tricked into running a specially crafted applet, private information could be leaked to a remote attacker, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-3883](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3880">CVE-2009-3880</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3882">CVE-2009-3882</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3883))

It was discovered that the ClassLoader did not correctly handle certain options. If a user were tricked into running a specially crafted applet, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2009-3881](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3881))

It was discovered that time zone file loading could be used to determine the existence of files on the local system. If a user were tricked into running a specially crafted applet, private information could be leaked to a remote attacker, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-3884](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3884))
