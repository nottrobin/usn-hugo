### thunderbird vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Software description

* thunderbird 

### Details

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine of Thunderbird. If a user were tricked into viewing malicious content, a remote attacker could use this to crash Thunderbird or possibly run arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1212](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1211">CVE-2010-1211</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1212))

An integer overflow was discovered in how Thunderbird processed CSS values. An attacker could exploit this to crash Thunderbird or possibly run arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-2752](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2752))

An integer overflow was discovered in how Thunderbird interpreted the XUL element. If a user were tricked into viewing malicious content, a remote attacker could use this to crash Thunderbird or possibly run arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-2753](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2753))

Aki Helin discovered that libpng did not properly handle certain malformed PNG images. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted PNG file, an attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1205](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1205))

Yosuke Hasegawa discovered that the same-origin check in Thunderbird could be bypassed by utilizing the importScripts Web Worker method. If a user were tricked into viewing malicious content, an attacker could exploit this to read data from other domains. ([CVE-2010-1213](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1213))

Chris Evans discovered that Thunderbird did not properly process improper CSS selectors. If a user were tricked into viewing malicious content, an attacker could exploit this to read data from other domains. ([CVE-2010-0654](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-0654))

Soroush Dalili discovered that Thunderbird did not properly handle script error output. An attacker could use this to access URL parameters from other domains. ([CVE-2010-2754](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2754))
