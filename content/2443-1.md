### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

 Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle faults associated with the Stack Segment (SS) register in the x86 architecture. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2014-9322](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-9322))

An information leak in the Linux kernel was discovered that could leak the high 16 bits of the kernel stack address on 32-bit Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) paravirt guests. A user in the guest OS could exploit this leak to obtain information that could potentially be used to aid in attacking the kernel. ([CVE-2014-8134](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8134))

Rabin Vincent, Robert Swiecki, Russell King discovered that the ftrace subsystem of the Linux kernel does not properly handle private syscall numbers. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (OOPS). ([CVE-2014-7826](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-7826))

Rabin Vincent, Robert Swiecki, Russell Kinglaw discovered a flaw in how the perf subsystem of the Linux kernel handles private systecall numbers. A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (OOPS) or bypass ASLR protections via a crafted application. ([CVE-2014-7825](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-7825))

A null pointer dereference flaw was discovered in the the Linux kernel&#39;s SCTP implementation when ASCONF is used. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) via a malformed INIT chunk. ([CVE-2014-7841](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-7841))

A stack buffer overflow was discovered in the ioctl command handling for the Technotrend/Hauppauge USB DEC devices driver. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2014-8884](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8884))

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle faults associated with the Stack Segment (SS) register on the x86 architecture. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (panic). ([CVE-2014-9090](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-9090)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-74-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-74.109](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-74.109) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-74-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-74.109](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-74.109) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-74-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-74.109](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-74.109) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-74-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-74.109](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-74.109) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-74-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-74.109](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-74.109) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-74-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-74.109](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-74.109) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-74-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-74.109](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-74.109) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
