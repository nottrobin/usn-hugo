### oxide-qt vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 15.10
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Oxide. 

### Software description

* oxide-qt 

### Details

A use-after-free was discovered when responding synchronously to permission requests. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2016-1578](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1578))

An out-of-bounds read was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash. ([CVE-2016-1646](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1646))

A use-after-free was discovered in the navigation implementation in Chromium in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2016-1647](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1647))

A buffer overflow was discovered in ANGLE. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2016-1649](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1649))

An out-of-bounds write was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed renderer process. ([CVE-2016-1653](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1653))

An invalid read was discovered in the media subsystem in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash. ([CVE-2016-1654](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1654))

It was discovered that frame removal during callback execution could trigger a use-after-free in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed renderer process. ([CVE-2016-1655](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1655))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2016-1659](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1659))

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2016-3679](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-3679))
