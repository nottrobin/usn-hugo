### nova regression

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 11.10

### Summary

USN 1466-1 introduced a regression in Nova. 

### Software description

* nova 

### Details

USN 1466-1 fixed a vulnerability in Nova. The upstream patch introduced a regression when a security group granted full access and therefore the network protocol was left unset, causing an error in processing. This update fixes the issue.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that, when defining security groups in Nova using the EC2 or OS APIs, specifying the network protocol (e.g. &#39;TCP&#39;) in the incorrect case would cause the security group to not be applied correctly. An attacker could use this to bypass Nova security group restrictions. 

### Update instructions

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
