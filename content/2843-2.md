    Jan Beulich discovered that the KVM svm hypervisor implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly catch Debug exceptions on AMD processors. An attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS. ([CVE-2015-8104](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8104))

### linux-lts-wily vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-wily 

### Details

Jan Beulich discovered that the KVM svm hypervisor implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly catch Debug exceptions on AMD processors. An attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host OS. ([CVE-2015-8104](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8104))

郭永刚 discovered that the ppp implementation in the Linux kernel did not ensure that certain slot numbers are valid. A local attacker with the privilege to call ioctl() on /dev/ppp could cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-7799](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7799))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Linux kernel&#39;s keyring handler attempted to garbage collect incompletely instantiated keys. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-7872](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7872))

It was discovered that the virtual video osd test driver in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize data structures. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive information from the kernel. ([CVE-2015-7884](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7884))

It was discovered that the driver for Digi Neo and ClassicBoard devices did not properly initialize data structures. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive information from the kernel. ([CVE-2015-7885](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7885)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
