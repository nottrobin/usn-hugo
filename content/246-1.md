description: |
    Florian Weimer discovered that the delegate code did not correctly handle file names which embed shell commands ([CVE-2006-0082](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2005-4601">CVE-2005-4601</a>). Daniel Kobras found a format string vulnerability in the SetImageInfo() function (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-0082)). By tricking a user into processing an image file with a specially crafted file name, these two vulnerabilities could be exploited to execute arbitrary commands with the user&#39;s privileges. These vulnerability become particularly critical if malicious images are sent as email attachments and the email client uses imagemagick to convert/display the images (e. g. Thunderbird and Gnus).

### imagemagick vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04
* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Florian Weimer discovered that the delegate code did not correctly handle file names which embed shell commands ([CVE-2006-0082](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2005-4601">CVE-2005-4601</a>). Daniel Kobras found a format string vulnerability in the SetImageInfo() function (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-0082)). By tricking a user into processing an image file with a specially crafted file name, these two vulnerabilities could be exploited to execute arbitrary commands with the user&#39;s privileges. These vulnerability become particularly critical if malicious images are sent as email attachments and the email client uses imagemagick to convert/display the images (e. g. Thunderbird and Gnus).

In addition, Eero Hï¿½inen reported a bug in the command line argument processing of the &#39;display&#39; command. Arguments that contained wildcards and were expanded to several files could trigger a heap overflow. However, there is no known possiblity to exploit this remotely. (http://bugs.debian.org/345595)
