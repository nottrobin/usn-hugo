    Matt Zimmerman discovered that entries in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys with options (such as &quot;no-port-forwarding&quot; or forced commands) were ignored by the new ssh-vulnkey tool introduced in OpenSSH (see USN-612-2). This could cause some compromised keys not to be listed in ssh-vulnkey&#39;s output.

### openssh update

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 7.10
* Ubuntu 7.04

### Software description

* openssh 

### Details

Matt Zimmerman discovered that entries in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys with options (such as &quot;no-port-forwarding&quot; or forced commands) were ignored by the new ssh-vulnkey tool introduced in OpenSSH (see USN-612-2). This could cause some compromised keys not to be listed in ssh-vulnkey&#39;s output.

This update also adds more information to ssh-vulnkey&#39;s manual page.

Original advisory details:

 A weakness has been discovered in the random number generator used by OpenSSL on Debian and Ubuntu systems. As a result of this weakness, certain encryption keys are much more common than they should be, such that an attacker could guess the key through a brute-force attack given minimal knowledge of the system. This particularly affects the use of encryption keys in OpenSSH, OpenVPN and SSL certificates. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:
