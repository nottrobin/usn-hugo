### clamav vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.10
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Software description

* clamav 

### Details

Arkadiusz Miskiewicz and others discovered that the PDF processing code in libclamav improperly validated input. This could allow a remote attacker to craft a PDF document that could crash clamav or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2010-4479](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4260">CVE-2010-4260</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4479))

It was discovered that an off-by-one error in the icon_cb function in pe_icons.c in libclamav could allow an attacker to corrupt memory, causing clamav to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2010-4261](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4261))

In the default installation, attackers would be isolated by the clamav AppArmor profile.
