    Cesar Bernardini and Felipe Andres Manzano discovered that FFmpeg incorrectly handled certain malformed flic files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted flic file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, 9.10 and 10.04 LTS. ([CVE-2010-3429](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-3429))
