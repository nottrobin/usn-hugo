### Details

Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Mats Palmgren, Chiaki Ishikawa, Bill Gianopoulos, Benoit Jacob, Gary Kwong, Robert O&#39;Callahan, Jesse Ruderman, and Julian Seward discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0770](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0769">CVE-2013-0769</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0749">CVE-2013-0749</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0770))

Abhishek Arya discovered several user-after-free and buffer overflows in Firefox. An attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-5829](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0760">CVE-2013-0760</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0761">CVE-2013-0761</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0762">CVE-2013-0762</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0763">CVE-2013-0763</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0766">CVE-2013-0766</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0767">CVE-2013-0767</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0771">CVE-2013-0771</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5829))

A stack buffer was discovered in Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0768](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0768))

Masato Kinugawa discovered that Firefox did not always properly display URL values in the address bar. A remote attacker could exploit this to conduct URL spoofing and phishing attacks. ([CVE-2013-0759](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0759))

Atte Kettunen discovered that Firefox did not properly handle HTML tables with a large number of columns and column groups. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0744](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0744))

Jerry Baker discovered that Firefox did not always properly handle threading when performing downloads over SSL connections. An attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash. ([CVE-2013-0764](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0764))

Olli Pettay and Boris Zbarsky discovered flaws in the Javacript engine of Firefox. An attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0746](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0745">CVE-2013-0745</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0746))

Jesse Ruderman discovered a flaw in the way Firefox handled plugins. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to bypass security protections to conduct clickjacking attacks. ([CVE-2013-0747](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0747))

Jesse Ruderman discovered an information leak in Firefox. An attacker could exploit this to reveal memory address layout which could help in bypassing ASLR protections. ([CVE-2013-0748](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0748))

An integer overflow was discovered in the Javascript engine, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0750](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0750))

Sviatoslav Chagaev discovered that Firefox did not properly handle XBL files with multiple XML bindings with SVG content. An attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0752](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0752))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered two flaws to gain access to privileged chrome functions. An attacker could possibly exploit this to execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0758](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0757">CVE-2013-0757</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0758))

Several use-after-free issues were discovered in Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0756](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0753">CVE-2013-0753</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0754">CVE-2013-0754</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0755">CVE-2013-0755</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0756))

Two intermediate CA certificates were mis-issued by the TURKTRUST certificate authority. If a remote attacker were able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-0743](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0743))
