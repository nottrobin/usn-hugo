This update fixes the problem.

Original advisory details:

 Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine of Firefox. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could use this to crash the browser or possibly run arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-2754](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1208">CVE-2010-1208</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1209">CVE-2010-1209</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1211">CVE-2010-1211</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1212">CVE-2010-1212</a>) An integer overflow was discovered in how Firefox processed plugin parameters. An attacker could exploit this to crash the browser or possibly run arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1214">CVE-2010-1214</a>) A flaw was discovered in the Firefox JavaScript engine. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker code execute arbitrary JavaScript with chrome privileges. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1215">CVE-2010-1215</a>) An integer overflow was discovered in how Firefox processed CSS values. An attacker could exploit this to crash the browser or possibly run arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2752">CVE-2010-2752</a>) An integer overflow was discovered in how Firefox interpreted the XUL &lt;tree&gt; element. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could use this to crash the browser or possibly run arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2753">CVE-2010-2753</a>) Aki Helin discovered that libpng did not properly handle certain malformed PNG images. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted PNG file, an attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1205">CVE-2010-1205</a>) Yosuke Hasegawa and Vladimir Vukicevic discovered that the same-origin check in Firefox could be bypassed by utilizing the importScripts Web Worker method. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website, an attacker could exploit this to read data from other domains. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1213">CVE-2010-1213</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1207">CVE-2010-1207</a>) O. Andersen that Firefox did not properly map undefined positions within certain 8 bit encodings. An attacker could utilize this to perform cross-site scripting attacks.

An attacker could exploit this to spoof the location bar, such as in a phishing attack. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1206">CVE-2010-1206</a>) Jordi Chancel discovered that Firefox did not properly handle when a server responds to an HTTPS request with plaintext and then processes JavaScript history events. An attacker could exploit this to spoof the location bar, such as in a phishing attack.
