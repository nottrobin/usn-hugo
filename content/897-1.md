    It was discovered that MySQL could be made to overwrite existing table files in the data directory.

This update alters table creation behaviour by disallowing the use of the MySQL data directory in DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.10.

### mysql-dfsg-5.0, mysql-dfsg-5.1 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 9.10
* Ubuntu 9.04
* Ubuntu 8.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* mysql-dfsg-5.0 

* mysql-dfsg-5.1 

### Details

It was discovered that MySQL could be made to overwrite existing table files in the data directory. An authenticated user could use the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options to possibly bypass privilege checks. This update alters table creation behaviour by disallowing the use of the MySQL data directory in DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.10. ([CVE-2008-4098](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4098)) 

It was discovered that MySQL contained a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the command-line client when the --html option is enabled. An attacker could place arbitrary web script or html in a database cell, which would then get placed in the html document output by the command-line tool. This issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 8.04 LTS, 8.10 and 9.04. ([CVE-2008-4456](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4456))

It was discovered that MySQL could be made to overwrite existing table files in the data directory. An authenticated user could use symlinks combined with the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options to possibly bypass privilege checks. This issue only affected Ubuntu 9.10. ([CVE-2008-7247](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-7247))

It was discovered that MySQL contained multiple format string flaws when logging database creation and deletion. An authenticated user could use specially crafted database names to make MySQL crash, causing a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 8.04 LTS, 8.10 and 9.04. ([CVE-2009-2446](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-2446))

It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled errors when performing certain SELECT statements, and did not preserve correct flags when performing statements that use the GeomFromWKB function. An authenticated user could exploit this to make MySQL crash, causing a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-4019](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-4019))

It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly checked symlinks when using the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options. A local user could use symlinks to create tables that pointed to tables known to be created at a later time, bypassing access restrictions. ([CVE-2009-4030](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-4030))

It was discovered that MySQL contained a buffer overflow when parsing ssl certificates. A remote attacker could send crafted requests and cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue did not affect Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and the default compiler options for affected releases should reduce the vulnerability to a denial of service. In the default installation, attackers would also be isolated by the AppArmor MySQL profile. ([CVE-2009-4484](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-4484))
