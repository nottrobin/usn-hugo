### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

 Rabin Vincent, Robert Swiecki, Russell King discovered that the ftrace subsystem of the Linux kernel does not properly handle private syscall numbers. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (OOPS). ([CVE-2014-7826](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-7826))

Rabin Vincent, Robert Swiecki, Russell Kinglaw discovered a flaw in how the perf subsystem of the Linux kernel handles private systecall numbers. A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (OOPS) or bypass ASLR protections via a crafted application. ([CVE-2014-7825](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-7825))

A null pointer dereference flaw was discovered in the the Linux kernel&#39;s SCTP implementation when ASCONF is used. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) via a malformed INIT chunk. ([CVE-2014-7841](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-7841))

A stack buffer overflow was discovered in the ioctl command handling for the Technotrend/Hauppauge USB DEC devices driver. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2014-8884](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8884)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-1457-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [3.2.0-1457.77](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1457.77) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
