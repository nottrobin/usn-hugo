    USN-1009-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the GNU C library. Colin Watson discovered that the fixes were incomplete and introduced flaws with setuid programs loading libraries that used dynamic string tokens in their RPATH. If the &quot;man&quot; program was installed setuid, a local attacker could exploit this to gain &quot;man&quot; user privileges, potentially leading to further privilege escalations. Default Ubuntu installations were not affected.

### eglibc, glibc vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.10
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 9.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Summary

Privilege escalation via loading of libraries via RPATH DSTs with setuid programs. 

### Software description

* eglibc 

* glibc 

### Details

USN-1009-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the GNU C library. Colin Watson discovered that the fixes were incomplete and introduced flaws with setuid programs loading libraries that used dynamic string tokens in their RPATH. If the &quot;man&quot; program was installed setuid, a local attacker could exploit this to gain &quot;man&quot; user privileges, potentially leading to further privilege escalations. Default Ubuntu installations were not affected.

Original advisory details:

 Tavis Ormandy discovered multiple flaws in the GNU C Library&#39;s handling of the LD_AUDIT environment variable when running a privileged binary. A local attacker could exploit this to gain root privileges. ([CVE-2010-3856](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-3847">CVE-2010-3847</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-3856))
