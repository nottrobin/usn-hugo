### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.10

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

Ben Hutchings reported a flaw in the Linux kernel with some network drivers that support TSO (TCP segment offload). A local or peer user could exploit this flaw to to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-3412](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3412))

Jay Fenlason and Doug Ledford discovered a bug in the Linux kernel implementation of RDS sockets. A local unprivileged user could potentially use this flaw to read privileged information from the kernel. ([CVE-2012-3430](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3430)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 11.10
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-1216-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [3.0.0-1216.28](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/3.0.0-1216.28) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
