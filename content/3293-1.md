### linux, linux-raspi2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 17.04

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

* linux-raspi2 

### Details

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that KVM implementation in the Linux kernel improperly emulated the VMXON instruction. A local attacker in a guest OS could use this to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) in the host OS. ([CVE-2017-2596](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-2596))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the generic SCSI (sg) subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a stack-based buffer overflow. A local attacker with access to an sg device could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-7187](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-7187))

It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference existed in the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) driver for VMWare devices in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-7261](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-7261))

Li Qiang discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) driver for VMWare devices in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-7294](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-7294))

Jason Donenfeld discovered a heap overflow in the MACsec module in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-7477](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-7477))

It was discovered that an information leak existed in the set_mempolicy and mbind compat syscalls in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2017-7616](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-7616)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 17.04
 : [linux-image-4.10.0-21-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [4.10.0-21.23](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/4.10.0-21.23) </span> 
 : linux-image-generic <span>4.10.0.21.23</span>
 : [linux-image-4.10.0-1005-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-raspi2) <span> [4.10.0-1005.7](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-raspi2/4.10.0-1005.7) </span> 
 : linux-image-generic-lpae <span>4.10.0.21.23</span>
 : [linux-image-4.10.0-21-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [4.10.0-21.23](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/4.10.0-21.23) </span> 
 : [linux-image-4.10.0-21-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [4.10.0-21.23](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/4.10.0-21.23) </span> 
 : linux-image-lowlatency <span>4.10.0.21.23</span>
 : linux-image-raspi2 <span>4.10.0.1005.7</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
