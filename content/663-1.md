    It was discovered that passwords changed (or new users created) via the &quot;Users and Groups&quot; tool were created with 3DES hashing.  This reduced the security of stored user passwords, and was a regression from the correct MD5 hashing.  This update fixes the problem; future password changes will correct the hashing used.  We apologize for the inconvenience.

### system-tools-backends regression

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.10

### Software description

* system-tools-backends 

### Details

It was discovered that passwords changed (or new users created) via the &quot;Users and Groups&quot; tool were created with 3DES hashing. This reduced the security of stored user passwords, and was a regression from the correct MD5 hashing. This update fixes the problem; future password changes will correct the hashing used. We apologize for the inconvenience. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 8.10
 : [system-tools-backends](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/system-tools-backends) <span> [2.6.0-1ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/system-tools-backends/2.6.0-1ubuntu1.1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the necessary changes.
