### thunderbird vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 9.04
* Ubuntu 8.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Software description

* thunderbird 

### Details

Several flaws were discovered in the JavaScript engine of Thunderbird. If a user had JavaScript enabled and were tricked into viewing malicious web content, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-1838](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1303">CVE-2009-1303</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1305">CVE-2009-1305</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1392">CVE-2009-1392</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1833">CVE-2009-1833</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1838))

Several flaws were discovered in the way Thunderbird processed malformed URI schemes. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website and had JavaScript and plugins enabled, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript or steal private data. ([CVE-2009-1309](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1306">CVE-2009-1306</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1307">CVE-2009-1307</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1309))

Cefn Hoile discovered Thunderbird did not adequately protect against embedded third-party stylesheets. If JavaScript were enabled, an attacker could exploit this to perform script injection attacks using XBL bindings. ([CVE-2009-1308](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1308))

Shuo Chen, Ziqing Mao, Yi-Min Wang, and Ming Zhang discovered that Thunderbird did not properly handle error responses when connecting to a proxy server. If a user had JavaScript enabled while using Thunderbird to view websites and a remote attacker were able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive information. ([CVE-2009-1836](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1836))

It was discovered that Thunderbird could be made to run scripts with elevated privileges. If a user had JavaScript enabled while having certain non-default add-ons installed and were tricked into viewing a malicious website, an attacker could cause a chrome privileged object, such as the browser sidebar, to run arbitrary code via interactions with the attacker controlled website. ([CVE-2009-1841](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1841))
