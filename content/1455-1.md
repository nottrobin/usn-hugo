### linux-lts-backport-oneiric vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-backport-oneiric 

### Details

 A flaw was found in the Linux kernel&#39;s KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) virtual cpu setup. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to crash the system leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-1601](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1601))

Steve Grubb reported a flaw with Linux fscaps (file system base capabilities) when used to increase the permissions of a process. For application on which fscaps are in use a local attacker can disable address space randomization to make attacking the process with raised privileges easier. ([CVE-2012-2123](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2123))

A flaw was found in how the Linux kernel passed the replacement session keyring to a child process. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (panic). ([CVE-2012-2745](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2745)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-20-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric) <span> [3.0.0-20.34~lucid1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric/3.0.0-20.34~lucid1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-20-server](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric) <span> [3.0.0-20.34~lucid1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric/3.0.0-20.34~lucid1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-20-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric) <span> [3.0.0-20.34~lucid1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric/3.0.0-20.34~lucid1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-20-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric) <span> [3.0.0-20.34~lucid1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric/3.0.0-20.34~lucid1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
