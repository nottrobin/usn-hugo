### Details

Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly validated MAC fields. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass authentication and spoof packets. ([CVE-2015-1798](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1798))

Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain invalid packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-1799](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1799))

Juergen Perlinger discovered that NTP incorrectly generated MD5 keys on big-endian platforms. This issue could either cause ntp-keygen to hang, or could result in non-random keys. (CVE number pending)
