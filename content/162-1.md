    Marcin Owsiany and Wojtek Kaniewski discovered that some contributed scripts (contrib/ekgh, contrib/ekgnv.sh, and contrib/getekg.sh) in the ekg package created temporary files in an insecure way, which allowed exploitation of a race condition to create or overwrite files with the privileges of the user invoking the script.

### ekg vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.04

### Details

Marcin Owsiany and Wojtek Kaniewski discovered that some contributed scripts (contrib/ekgh, contrib/ekgnv.sh, and contrib/getekg.sh) in the ekg package created temporary files in an insecure way, which allowed exploitation of a race condition to create or overwrite files with the privileges of the user invoking the script. (CAN-2005-1850)

Marcin Owsiany and Wojtek Kaniewski discovered a shell command injection vulnerability in a contributed utility (contrib/scripts/ekgbot-pre1.py). By sending specially crafted content to the bot, an attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running ekgbot. (CAN-2005-1851)

Marcin Ślusarz discovered an integer overflow in the Gadu library. By sending a specially crafted incoming message, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application using libgadu. (CAN-2005-1852)

Eric Romang discovered that another contributed script (contrib/scripts/linki.py) created temporary files in an insecure way, which allowed exploitation of a race condition to create or overwrite files with the privileges of the user invoking the script. (CAN-2005-1916)

Grzegorz Jaśkiewicz discovered several integer overflows in the Gadu library. A remote attacker could exploit this to crash the Gadu client application or even execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user by sending specially crafted messages. (CAN-2005-2369)

Szymon Zygmunt and Michał Bartoszkiewicz discovered a memory alignment error in the Gadu library. By sending specially crafted messages, a remote attacker could crash the application using the library. (CAN-2005-2370)

Marcin Ślusarz discovered that the Gadu library did not properly handle endianess conversion in some cases. This caused invalid behavior on big endian architectures. The only affected supported architecture is powerpc. (CAN-2005-2448)
