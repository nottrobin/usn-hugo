description: |
    It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not check if a new IPv6 MTU set by a user space application was valid. A remote attacker could forge a route advertisement with an invalid MTU that a user space daemon like NetworkManager would honor and apply to the kernel, causing a denial of service.

### linux-lts-vivid vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-vivid 

### Details

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not check if a new IPv6 MTU set by a user space application was valid. A remote attacker could forge a route advertisement with an invalid MTU that a user space daemon like NetworkManager would honor and apply to the kernel, causing a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-0272](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0272))

It was discovered that virtio networking in the Linux kernel did not handle fragments correctly, leading to kernel memory corruption. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute code with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2015-5156](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-5156))

It was discovered that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) implementation in the Linux kernel did not verify sockets were properly bound before attempting to send a message, which could cause a NULL pointer dereference. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-6937](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-6937))

Ben Hutchings discovered that the Advanced Union Filesystem (aufs) for the Linux kernel did not correctly handle references of memory mapped files from an aufs mount. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2015-7312](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7312)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
