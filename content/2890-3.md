### linux-raspi2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 15.10

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-raspi2 

### Details

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the AF_UNIX implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use crafted epoll_ctl calls to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-7446](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-7446))

It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly restore the values of the Programmable Interrupt Timer (PIT). A user-assisted attacker in a KVM guest could cause a denial of service in the host (system crash). ([CVE-2015-7513](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7513))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel keyring subsystem contained a race between read and revoke operations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-7550](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7550))

Sasha Levin discovered that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) implementation in the Linux kernel had a race condition when checking whether a socket was bound or not. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-7990](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7990))

It was discovered that the Btrfs implementation in the Linux kernel incorrectly handled compressed inline extants on truncation. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2015-8374](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8374))

郭永刚 discovered that the Linux kernel networking implementation did not validate protocol identifiers for certain protocol families, A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2015-8543](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8543))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the pptp implementation in the Linux kernel did not verify an address length when setting up a socket. A local attacker could use this to craft an application that exposed sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2015-8569](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8569))

David Miller discovered that the Bluetooth implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the socket address length for Synchronous Connection-Oriented (SCO) sockets. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2015-8575](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8575))

It was discovered that the netfilter Network Address Translation (NAT) implementation did not ensure that data structures were initialized when handling IPv4 addresses. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-8787](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8787)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 15.10
 : [linux-image-4.2.0-1022-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-raspi2) <span> [4.2.0-1022.29](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-raspi2/4.2.0-1022.29) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
