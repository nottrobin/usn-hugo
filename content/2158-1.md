### linux-lts-raring vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-raring 

### Details

Stephan Mueller reported an error in the Linux kernel&#39;s ansi cprng random number generator. This flaw makes it easier for a local attacker to break cryptographic protections. ([CVE-2013-4345](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4345))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported buffer underflow errors in the implementation of the XFS filesystem in the Linux kernel. A local user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN could exploit these flaw to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly other unspecified issues. ([CVE-2013-6382](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-6382))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel when built with the NetFilter Connection Tracking (NF_CONNTRACK) support for IRC protocol (NF_NAT_IRC). A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive kernel information when communicating over a client- to-client IRC connection(/dcc) via a NAT-ed network. ([CVE-2014-1690](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1690)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.8.0-38-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-raring) <span> [3.8.0-38.56~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-raring/3.8.0-38.56~precise1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
