* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird. 

### Software description

* thunderbird 

### Details

Multiple memory safety issues were discovered in Thunderbird.

([CVE-2017-5373](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-9893">CVE-2016-9893</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-5373))

Andrew Krasichkov discovered that event handlers on &lt;marquee&gt; elements were executed despite a Content Security Policy (CSP) that disallowed inline JavaScript. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2016-9895](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-9895))

A memory corruption issue was discovered in WebGL in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-9897](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-9897))

A use-after-free was discovered when manipulating DOM subtrees in the Editor. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-9898](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-9898))

A use-after-free was discovered when manipulating DOM events and audio elements. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code.

It was discovered that external resources that should be blocked when loading SVG images can bypass security restrictions using data: URLs. An attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-9900](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-9900))

Jann Horn discovered that JavaScript Map/Set were vulnerable to timing attacks. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information across domains. ([CVE-2016-9904](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-9904))

A crash was discovered in EnumerateSubDocuments while adding or removing sub-documents. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-9905](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-9905))

JIT code allocation can allow a bypass of ASLR protections in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code.

([CVE-2017-5378](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-5378))

A use-after-free was discovered during DOM manipulation of SVG content in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code.
