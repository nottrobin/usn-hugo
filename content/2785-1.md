    Christian Holler, David Major, Jesse Ruderman, Tyson Smith, Boris Zbarsky, Randell Jesup, Olli Pettay, Karl Tomlinson, Jeff Walden, Gary Kwong, Andrew McCreight, Georg Fritzsche, and Carsten Book discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

### Details

Christian Holler, David Major, Jesse Ruderman, Tyson Smith, Boris Zbarsky, Randell Jesup, Olli Pettay, Karl Tomlinson, Jeff Walden, Gary Kwong, Andrew McCreight, Georg Fritzsche, and Carsten Book discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-4514](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-4513">CVE-2015-4513</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-4514))

Tim Brown discovered that Firefox discloses the hostname during NTLM authentication in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website with NTLM v1 enabled, an attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2015-4515](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-4515))

Mario Heiderich and Frederik Braun discovered that CSP could be bypassed in reader mode in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2015-4518](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-4518))

Tyson Smith and David Keeler discovered a use-after-poison and buffer overflow in NSS. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-7182](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7181">CVE-2015-7181</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7182))

Ryan Sleevi discovered an integer overflow in NSPR. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-7183](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7183))

Jason Hamilton, Peter Arremann and Sylvain Giroux discovered that panels created via the Addon SDK with { script: false } could still execute inline script. If a user installed an addon that relied on this as a security mechanism, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, depending on the source of the panel content. ([CVE-2015-7187](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7187))

Michał Bentkowski discovered that adding white-space to hostnames that are IP address can bypass same-origin protections. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2015-7188](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7188))

Looben Yang discovered a buffer overflow during script interactions with the canvas element in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-7189](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7189))

Shinto K Anto discovered that CORS preflight is bypassed when receiving non-standard Content-Type headers in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions. ([CVE-2015-7193](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7193))

Gustavo Grieco discovered a buffer overflow in libjar in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-7194](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7194))

Frans Rosén discovered that certain escaped characters in the Location header are parsed incorrectly, resulting in a navigation to the previously parsed version of a URL. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain site specific tokens. ([CVE-2015-7195](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7195))

Vytautas Staraitis discovered a garbage collection crash when interacting with Java applets in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website with the Java plugin installed, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-7196](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7196))

Ehsan Akhgari discovered a mechanism for a web worker to bypass secure requirements for web sockets. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could exploit this to bypass the mixed content web socket policy. ([CVE-2015-7197](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7197))

Ronald Crane discovered several vulnerabilities through code-inspection. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-7200](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7198">CVE-2015-7198</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7199">CVE-2015-7199</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7200))
