    It was discovered that Audio File Library contained a heap-based buffer overflow. If a user or automated system processed a crafted WAV file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. The default compiler options for Ubuntu should reduce this vulnerability to a denial of service.
