### oxide-qt vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Oxide. 

### Software description

* oxide-qt 

### Details

Multiple use-after-free issues were discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2014-3192](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3178">CVE-2014-3178</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3190">CVE-2014-3190</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3191">CVE-2014-3191</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3192))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2014-3200](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3179">CVE-2014-3179</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3200))

It was discovered that Chromium did not properly handle the interaction of IPC and V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2014-3188](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3188))

A use-after-free was discovered in the web workers implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via applicatin crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2014-3194](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3194))

It was discovered that V8 did not correctly handle Javascript heap allocations in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to steal sensitive information. ([CVE-2014-3195](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3195))

It was discovered that Blink did not properly provide substitute data for pages blocked by the XSS auditor. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafter website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to steal sensitive information. ([CVE-2014-3197](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3197))

It was discovered that the wrap function for Event&#39;s in the V8 bindings in Blink produced an erroneous result in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service by stopping a worker process that was handling an Event object. ([CVE-2014-3199](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3199))

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2014-7967](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-7967))
