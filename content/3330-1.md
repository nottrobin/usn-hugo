    It was discovered that the stack guard page for processes in the Linux kernel was not sufficiently large enough to prevent overlapping with the heap. An attacker could leverage this with another vulnerability to execute arbitrary code and gain administrative privileges ([CVE-2017-1000364](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-1000364))

### linux-meta-snapdragon, linux-snapdragon vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-snapdragon 

### Details

It was discovered that the stack guard page for processes in the Linux kernel was not sufficiently large enough to prevent overlapping with the heap. An attacker could leverage this with another vulnerability to execute arbitrary code and gain administrative privileges ([CVE-2017-1000364](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-1000364))

Roee Hay discovered that the parallel port printer driver in the Linux kernel did not properly bounds check passed arguments. A local attacker with write access to the kernel command line arguments could use this to execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-1000363](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-1000363))

A reference count bug was discovered in the Linux kernel ipx protocol stack. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified problems. ([CVE-2017-7487](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-7487))

A double free bug was discovered in the IPv4 stack of the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-8890](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-8890))

Andrey Konovalov discovered an IPv6 out-of-bounds read error in the Linux kernel&#39;s IPv6 stack. A local attacker could cause a denial of service or potentially other unspecified problems. ([CVE-2017-9074](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-9074))

Andrey Konovalov discovered a flaw in the handling of inheritance in the Linux kernel&#39;s IPv6 stack. A local user could exploit this issue to cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified problems. ([CVE-2017-9075](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-9075))

It was discovered that dccp v6 in the Linux kernel mishandled inheritance. A local attacker could exploit this issue to cause a denial of service or potentially other unspecified problems. ([CVE-2017-9076](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-9076))

It was discovered that the transmission control protocol (tcp) v6 in the Linux kernel mishandled inheritance. A local attacker could exploit this issue to cause a denial of service or potentially other unspecified problems. ([CVE-2017-9077](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-9077))

It was discovered that the IPv6 stack was doing over write consistency check after the data was actually overwritten. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-9242](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-9242)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-snapdragon](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-snapdragon) <span> [4.4.0.1061.54](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-snapdragon/4.4.0-1061.66) </span> 
 : [linux-image-4.4.0-1061-snapdragon](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-snapdragon) <span> [4.4.0-1061.66](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-snapdragon/4.4.0-1061.66) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
