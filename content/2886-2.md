### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the AF_UNIX implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use crafted epoll_ctl calls to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-7446](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-7446))

It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly restore the values of the Programmable Interrupt Timer (PIT). A user-assisted attacker in a KVM guest could cause a denial of service in the host (system crash). ([CVE-2015-7513](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7513))

郭永刚 discovered that the ppp implementation in the Linux kernel did not ensure that certain slot numbers are valid. A local attacker with the privilege to call ioctl() on /dev/ppp could cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-7799](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7799))

Sasha Levin discovered that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) implementation in the Linux kernel had a race condition when checking whether a socket was bound or not. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-7990](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7990))

It was discovered that the Btrfs implementation in the Linux kernel incorrectly handled compressed inline extants on truncation. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2015-8374](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8374))

郭永刚 discovered that the Linux kernel networking implementation did not validate protocol identifiers for certain protocol families, A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2015-8543](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8543))

Felix Wilhelm discovered a race condition in the Xen paravirtualized drivers which can cause double fetch vulnerabilities. An attacker in the paravirtualized guest could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash the host) or potentially execute arbitrary code on the host. ([CVE-2015-8550](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8550))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the pptp implementation in the Linux kernel did not verify an address length when setting up a socket. A local attacker could use this to craft an application that exposed sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2015-8569](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8569))

David Miller discovered that the Bluetooth implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the socket address length for Synchronous Connection-Oriented (SCO) sockets. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2015-8575](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8575))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel&#39;s Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) implementation did not handle initial zero length segments properly. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (unkillable task). ([CVE-2015-8785](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8785)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-1476-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [3.2.0-1476.99](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1476.99) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
