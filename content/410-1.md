### Details

The poppler PDF loader library did not limit the recursion depth of the page model tree. By tricking a user into opening a specially crafter PDF file, this could be exploited to trigger an infinite loop and eventually crash an application that uses this library.

kpdf in Ubuntu 5.10, and KOffice in all Ubuntu releases contains a copy of this code and thus is affected as well.
