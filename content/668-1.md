### Details

Georgi Guninski, Michal Zalewsk and Chris Evans discovered that the same-origin check in Thunderbird could be bypassed. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker could obtain private information from data stored in the images, or discover information about software on the user&#39;s computer. ([CVE-2008-5012](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5012))

Jesse Ruderman discovered that Thunderbird did not properly guard locks on non-native objects. If a user had JavaScript enabled and were tricked into opening malicious web content, an attacker could cause a browser crash and possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-5014](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5014))

Several problems were discovered in the browser, layout and JavaScript engines. If a user had JavaScript enabled, these problems could allow an attacker to crash Thunderbird and possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-5018](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5016">CVE-2008-5016</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5017">CVE-2008-5017</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5018))

A flaw was discovered in Thunderbird&#39;s DOM constructing code. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website while having JavaScript enabled, an attacker could cause the browser to crash and potentially execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-5021](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5021))

It was discovered that the same-origin check in Thunderbird could be bypassed. If a user had JavaScript enabled and were tricked into opening malicious web content, an attacker could execute JavaScript in the context of a different website. ([CVE-2008-5022](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5022))

Chris Evans discovered that Thunderbird did not properly parse E4X documents, leading to quote characters in the namespace not being properly escaped. ([CVE-2008-5024](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5024))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that Thunderbird did not properly process comments in forwarded in-line messages. If a user had JavaScript enabled and opened a malicious email, an attacker may be able to obtain information about the recipient.
