    Steffen Joeris discovered that PyGreSQL 3.8 did not use PostgreSQL&#39;s safe string and bytea functions in its own escaping functions. As a result, applications written to use PyGreSQL&#39;s escaping functions are vulnerable to SQL injections when processing certain multi-byte character sequences. Because the safe functions require a database connection, to maintain backwards compatibility, pg.escape_string() and pg.escape_bytea() are still available, but applications will have to be adjusted to use the new pyobj.escape_string() and pyobj.escape_bytea() functions. For example, code containing:

### pygresql vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Software description

* pygresql 

### Details

Steffen Joeris discovered that PyGreSQL 3.8 did not use PostgreSQL&#39;s safe string and bytea functions in its own escaping functions. As a result, applications written to use PyGreSQL&#39;s escaping functions are vulnerable to SQL injections when processing certain multi-byte character sequences. Because the safe functions require a database connection, to maintain backwards compatibility, pg.escape_string() and pg.escape_bytea() are still available, but applications will have to be adjusted to use the new pyobj.escape_string() and pyobj.escape_bytea() functions. For example, code containing:

 import pg connection = pg.connect(...) escaped = pg.escape_string(untrusted_input)

should be adjusted to use:

 import pg connection = pg.connect(...) escaped = connection.escape_string(untrusted_input)

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 8.10
 : [python-pygresql](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pygresql) <span> [1:3.8.1-3ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pygresql/1:3.8.1-3ubuntu0.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
 : [python-pygresql](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pygresql) <span> [1:3.8.1-2ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pygresql/1:3.8.1-2ubuntu0.1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the necessary changes.
