series: [ ubuntu-4.10]

description: |
    Besides providing the global system-wide communication bus, dbus also offers per-user &quot;session&quot; buses which applications in an user&#39;s session can create and use to communicate with each other.  Daniel Reed discovered that the default configuration of the session dbus allowed a local user to connect to another user&#39;s session bus if its address was known. The fixed packages restrict the default permissions to the user who owns the session dbus instance.

### dbus vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Besides providing the global system-wide communication bus, dbus also offers per-user &quot;session&quot; buses which applications in an user&#39;s session can create and use to communicate with each other. Daniel Reed discovered that the default configuration of the session dbus allowed a local user to connect to another user&#39;s session bus if its address was known. The fixed packages restrict the default permissions to the user who owns the session dbus instance.

Please note that a standard Ubuntu installation does not use the session bus for anything, so this can only be exploited if you are using custom software which uses it.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 4.10
 : dbus-1 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).
