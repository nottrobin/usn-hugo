    It was discovered that Kerberos did not properly determine the acceptability of certain checksums. A remote attacker could use certain checksums to alter the prompt message, modify a response to a Key Distribution Center (KDC) or forge a KRB-SAFE message.

### Details

It was discovered that Kerberos did not properly determine the acceptability of certain checksums. A remote attacker could use certain checksums to alter the prompt message, modify a response to a Key Distribution Center (KDC) or forge a KRB-SAFE message. ([CVE-2010-1323](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1323))

It was discovered that Kerberos did not properly determine the acceptability of certain checksums. A remote attacker could use certain checksums to forge GSS tokens or gain privileges. This issue only affected Ubuntu 9.10, 10.04 LTS and 10.10. ([CVE-2010-1324](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1324))

It was discovered that Kerberos did not reject RC4 key-derivation checksums. An authenticated remote user could use this issue to forge AD-SIGNEDPATH or AD-KDC-ISSUED signatures and possibly gain privileges. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and 10.10. ([CVE-2010-4020](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4020))

It was discovered that Kerberos did not properly restrict the use of TGT credentials for armoring TGS requests. A remote authenticated user could use this flaw to impersonate a client. This issue only affected Ubuntu 9.10. ([CVE-2010-4021](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4021))
