### tetex-bin vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.10

### Details

USN-410-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the poppler PDF loader library. This update provides the corresponding updates for a copy of this code in tetex-bin in Ubuntu 5.10. Versions of tetex-bin after Ubuntu 5.10 use poppler directly and do not need a separate update.

Original advisory details:

 The poppler PDF loader library did not limit the recursion depth of the page model tree. By tricking a user into opening a specially crafter PDF file, this could be exploited to trigger an infinite loop and eventually crash an application that uses this library.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 5.10
 : tetex-bin <span>2.0.2-30ubuntu3.6</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the necessary changes.
