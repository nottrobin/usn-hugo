    A race condition was discovered in the MutationObserver implementation in Blink.

### Details

A race condition was discovered in the MutationObserver implementation in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-6789](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-6789))

An issue was discovered with the page serializer in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to inject arbitrary script or HTML. ([CVE-2015-6790](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-6790))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-6791](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-6791))

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-8548](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8548))

An integer overflow was discovered in the WebCursor::Deserialize function in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-8664](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8664))
