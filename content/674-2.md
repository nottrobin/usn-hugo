### hplip vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 7.10

### Software description

* hplip 

### Details

USN-674-1 provided packages to fix vulnerabilities in HPLIP. Due to an internal archive problem, the updates for Ubuntu 7.10 would not install properly. This update provides fixed packages for Ubuntu 7.10.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that the hpssd tool of hplip did not validate privileges in the alert-mailing function. A local attacker could exploit this to gain privileges and send e-mail messages from the account of the hplip user. This update alters hplip behaviour by preventing users from setting alerts and by moving alert configuration to a root-controlled /etc/hp/alerts.conf file. ([CVE-2008-2941](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2940">CVE-2008-2940</a>) It was discovered that the hpssd tool of hplip did not correctly handle certain commands. A local attacker could use a specially crafted packet to crash hpssd, leading to a denial of service. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2941))
