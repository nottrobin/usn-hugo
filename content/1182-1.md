    Yoshihiro Ishikawa discovered that the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) was vulnerable to cross-site request forgeries (CSRF). If a Samba administrator were tricked into clicking a link on a specially crafted web page, an attacker could trigger commands that could modify the Samba configuration.

### Details

Yoshihiro Ishikawa discovered that the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) was vulnerable to cross-site request forgeries (CSRF). If a Samba administrator were tricked into clicking a link on a specially crafted web page, an attacker could trigger commands that could modify the Samba configuration. ([CVE-2011-2522](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2522))

Nobuhiro Tsuji discovered that the Samba Web Administration Tool (SWAT) did not properly sanitize its input when processing password change requests, resulting in cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing server output during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2011-2694](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2694))
