### linux-lts-backport-natty vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-backport-natty 

### Details

Andy Adamson discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s NFSv4 implementation. A remote NFS server (attacker) could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-4131](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4131))

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel&#39;s KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) virtual cpu setup. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to crash the system leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-1601](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1601))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s KVM (kernel virtual machine). An administrative user in the guest OS could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service in the host OS. ([CVE-2012-2121](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2121))

Steve Grubb reported a flaw with Linux fscaps (file system base capabilities) when used to increase the permissions of a process. For application on which fscaps are in use a local attacker can disable address space randomization to make attacking the process with raised privileges easier. ([CVE-2012-2123](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2123))

Schacher Raindel discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s memory handling when hugetlb is enabled. An unprivileged local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service and potentially gain higher privileges. ([CVE-2012-2133](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2133))
