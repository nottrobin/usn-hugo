Dan Rosenberg reported an error in the old ABI compatibility layer of ARM kernels. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service or gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-1759](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1759))

Ben Hutchings reported a flaw in the kernel&#39;s handling of corrupt LDM partitions. A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service or escalate privileges. ([CVE-2011-2182](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2182))

The linux kernel did not properly account for PTE pages when deciding which task to kill in out of memory conditions. A local, unprivileged could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2498](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2498))

A flaw was discovered in the TOMOYO LSM&#39;s handling of mount system calls. An unprivileged user could oops the system causing a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2518](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2518))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s AppArmor security interface when invalid information was written to it. An unprivileged local user could use this to cause a denial of service on the system. ([CVE-2011-3619](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3619))
