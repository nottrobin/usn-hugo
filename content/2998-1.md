### linux-lts-trusty vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-trusty 

### Details

Justin Yackoski discovered that the Atheros L2 Ethernet Driver in the Linux kernel incorrectly enables scatter/gather I/O. A remote attacker could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-2117](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2117))

Jann Horn discovered that eCryptfs improperly attempted to use the mmap() handler of a lower filesystem that did not implement one, causing a recursive page fault to occur. A local unprivileged attacker could use to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-1583](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1583))

Jason A. Donenfeld discovered multiple out-of-bounds reads in the OZMO USB over wifi device drivers in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2015-4004](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-4004))

Andy Lutomirski discovered a race condition in the Linux kernel&#39;s translation lookaside buffer (TLB) handling of flush events. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly leak sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-2069](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2069))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Linux kernel&#39;s GTCO digitizer USB device driver did not properly validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2187](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2187))

Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll discovered that the Linux kernel would improperly disable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) for x86 processes running in 32 bit mode if stack-consumption resource limits were disabled. A local attacker could use this to make it easier to exploit an existing vulnerability in a setuid/setgid program. ([CVE-2016-3672](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-3672))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the CDC Network Control Model USB driver in the Linux kernel did not cancel work events queued if a later error occurred, resulting in a use-after-free. An attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3951](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-3951))

It was discovered that an out-of-bounds write could occur when handling incoming packets in the USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-3955](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-3955))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 Support implementations in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-4485](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4485))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the routing netlink socket interface (rtnetlink) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-4486](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4486))

It was discovered that in some situations the Linux kernel did not handle propagated mounts correctly. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4581](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4581)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-88-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty) <span> [3.13.0-88.135~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-88.135~precise1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-88-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty) <span> [3.13.0-88.135~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-88.135~precise1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
