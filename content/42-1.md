description: |
    Several buffer overflows have been discovered in xine-lib, the video/audio codec library for Xine frontends (xine-ui, totem-xine, kaffeine, and others). If an attacker tricked a user into loading a malicious RTSP stream or a stream with specially crafted AIFF audio or PNM image data, they could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user opening the audio/video file.
