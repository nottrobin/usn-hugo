### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.10

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

A flaw was discovered in the Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) subsystem of the Linux kernel. A guest OS user could exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary code on the host OS. ([CVE-2014-0049](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-0049))

Al Viro discovered an error in how CIFS in the Linux kernel handles uncached write operations. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash), obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, or possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2014-0069](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-0069)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.10
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-49-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-49.73](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-49.73) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-49-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-49.73](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-49.73) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-49-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-49.73](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-49.73) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-49-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-49.73](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-49.73) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-49-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-49.73](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-49.73) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
