    Michal Zalewski discovered that Bash incorrectly handled parsing certain function definitions. If an attacker were able to create an environment variable containing a function definition with a very specific name, these issues could possibly be used to bypass certain environment restrictions and execute arbitrary code.

### Details

Michal Zalewski discovered that Bash incorrectly handled parsing certain function definitions. If an attacker were able to create an environment variable containing a function definition with a very specific name, these issues could possibly be used to bypass certain environment restrictions and execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-6278](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-6277">CVE-2014-6277</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-6278))

Please note that the previous Bash security update, USN-2364-1, includes a hardening measure that prevents these issues from being used in a Shellshock attack.
