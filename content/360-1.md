    awstats did not fully sanitize input, which was passed directly to the user&#39;s browser, allowing for an XSS attack.  If a user was tricked into following a specially crafted awstats URL, the user&#39;s authentication information could be exposed for the domain where awstats was hosted.

### awstats vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04

### Details

awstats did not fully sanitize input, which was passed directly to the user&#39;s browser, allowing for an XSS attack. If a user was tricked into following a specially crafted awstats URL, the user&#39;s authentication information could be exposed for the domain where awstats was hosted. ([CVE-2006-3681](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3681))

awstats could display its installation path under certain conditions. However, this might only become a concern if awstats is installed into an user&#39;s home directory. ([CVE-2006-3682](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3682))
