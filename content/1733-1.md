### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Ruby. 

### Software description

* ruby1.9.1 

### Details

Jean-Philippe Aumasson discovered that Ruby incorrectly generated predictable hash values. An attacker could use this issue to generate hash collisions and cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-5371](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5371))

Evgeny Ermakov discovered that documentation generated by rdoc is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting issue. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2013-0256](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0256))

Thomas Hollstegge and Ben Murphy discovered that the JSON implementation in Ruby incorrectly handled certain crafted documents. An attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service or bypass certain protection mechanisms. ([CVE-2013-0269](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0269))
