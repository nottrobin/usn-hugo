    It was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled the strxfrm() function. An attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2015-8982](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8982))

### eglibc, glibc vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the GNU C Library. 

### Software description

* eglibc 

* glibc 

### Details

It was discovered that the GNU C Library incorrectly handled the strxfrm() function. An attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2015-8982](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8982))

It was discovered that an integer overflow existed in the _IO_wstr_overflow() function of the GNU C Library. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2015-8983](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8983))

It was discovered that the fnmatch() function in the GNU C Library did not properly handle certain malformed patterns. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2015-8984](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8984))

Alexander Cherepanov discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the glob implementation of the GNU C Library. An attacker could use this to specially craft a directory layout and cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-1234](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1234))

Florian Weimer discovered a NULL pointer dereference in the DNS resolver of the GNU C Library. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-5180](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-5180))

Michael Petlan discovered an unbounded stack allocation in the getaddrinfo() function of the GNU C Library. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-3706](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-3706))

Aldy Hernandez discovered an unbounded stack allocation in the sunrpc implementation in the GNU C Library. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-4429](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4429))

Tim Ruehsen discovered that the getaddrinfo() implementation in the GNU C Library did not properly track memory allocations. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2016-5417](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5417))

Andreas Schwab discovered that the GNU C Library on ARM 32-bit platforms did not properly set up execution contexts. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-6323](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-6323)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
 : [libc6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glibc) <span> [2.23-0ubuntu6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glibc/2.23-0ubuntu6) </span> 

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 : [libc6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/eglibc) <span> [2.19-0ubuntu6.10](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/eglibc/2.19-0ubuntu6.10) </span> 

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [libc6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/eglibc) <span> [2.15-0ubuntu10.16](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/eglibc/2.15-0ubuntu10.16) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.
