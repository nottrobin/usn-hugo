### xine-lib vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.04
* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Ulf Harnhammar discovered a format string vulnerability in the CDDB module&#39;s cache file handling in the Xine library, which is used by packages such as xine-ui, totem-xine, and gxine.

By tricking an user into playing a particular audio CD which has a specially-crafted CDDB entry, a remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application. Since CDDB servers usually allow anybody to add and modify information, this exploit does not even require a particular CDDB server to be selected.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 5.04
 : libxine1 

Ubuntu 4.10
 : libxine1 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).
