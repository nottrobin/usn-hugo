    It was discovered that MySQL could be made to overwrite existing table files in the data directory.

This update alters table creation behaviour by disallowing the use of the MySQL data directory in DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options.

### mysql-dfsg-5.0 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 7.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* mysql-dfsg-5.0 

### Details

It was discovered that MySQL could be made to overwrite existing table files in the data directory. An authenticated user could use the DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options to possibly bypass privilege checks. This update alters table creation behaviour by disallowing the use of the MySQL data directory in DATA DIRECTORY and INDEX DIRECTORY options. ([CVE-2008-4098](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2079">CVE-2008-2079</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4097">CVE-2008-4097</a> and <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4098))

It was discovered that MySQL did not handle empty bit-string literals properly. An attacker could exploit this problem and cause the MySQL server to crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-3963](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3963))
