### krb5 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 7.10
* Ubuntu 7.04
* Ubuntu 6.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* krb5 

### Details

It was discovered that krb5 did not correctly handle certain krb4 requests. An unauthenticated remote attacker could exploit this flaw by sending a specially crafted traffic, which could expose sensitive information, cause a crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2008-0063](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0062">CVE-2008-0062</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0063))

A flaw was discovered in the kadmind service&#39;s handling of file descriptors. An unauthenticated remote attacker could send specially crafted requests that would cause a crash, resulting in a denial of service. Only systems with configurations allowing large numbers of open file descriptors were vulnerable. ([CVE-2008-0947](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0947))
