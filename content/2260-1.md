### linux-lts-trusty vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-trusty 

### Details

 A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s pseudo tty (pty) device. An unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially gain administrator privileges. ([CVE-2014-0196](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-0196))

Pinkie Pie discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s futex subsystem. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2014-3153](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3153))

Matthew Daley reported an information leak in the floppy disk driver of the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1738](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1738))

Matthew Daley reported a flaw in the handling of ioctl commands by the floppy disk driver in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges if the floppy disk module is loaded. ([CVE-2014-1737](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1737))

A flaw was discovered in the handling of network packets when mergeable buffers are disabled for virtual machines in the Linux kernel. Guest OS users may exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or possibly gain privilege on the host OS. ([CVE-2014-0077](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-0077))

An information leak was discovered in the netfilter subsystem of the Linux kernel. An attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-2568](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-2568))

Török Edwin discovered a flaw with Xen netback driver when used with Linux configurations that do not allow sleeping in softirq context. A guest administrator could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) on the host. ([CVE-2014-2580](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-2580))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s ping sockets. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain privileges via a crafted application. ([CVE-2014-2851](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-2851))

Sasha Levin reported a bug in the Linux kernel&#39;s virtual memory management subsystem. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2014-3122](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3122))

Hannes Frederic Sowa reported a hash collision ordering problem in the xfs filesystem in the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause filesystem corruption and a denial of service (oops or panic). ([CVE-2014-7283](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-7283)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-30-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty) <span> [3.13.0-30.54~precise2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-30.54~precise2) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-30-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty) <span> [3.13.0-30.54~precise2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-30.54~precise2) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
