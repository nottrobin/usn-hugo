### openoffice.org2-amd64, openoffice.org2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.10

### Details

USN-313-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in OpenOffice for Ubuntu 5.04 and Ubuntu 6.06 LTS. This followup advisory provides the corresponding update for Ubuntu 5.10.

For reference, these are the details of the original USN:

 It was possible to embed Basic macros in documents in a way that OpenOffice.org would not ask for confirmation about executing them. By tricking a user into opening a malicious document, this could be exploited to run arbitrary Basic code (including local file access and modification) with the user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2006-3117](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-2198">CVE-2006-2198</a>) A flaw was discovered in the Java sandbox which allowed Java applets to break out of the sandbox and execute code without restrictions. By tricking a user into opening a malicious document, this could be exploited to run arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges. This update disables Java applets for OpenOffice.org, since it is not generally possible to guarantee the sandbox restrictions. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-2199">CVE-2006-2199</a>) A buffer overflow has been found in the XML parser. By tricking a user into opening a specially crafted XML file with OpenOffice.org, this could be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges.
