### openssl vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 9.04
* Ubuntu 8.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* openssl 

### Details

It was discovered that OpenSSL did not limit the number of DTLS records it would buffer when they arrived with a future epoch. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service via memory resource consumption by sending a large number of crafted requests. ([CVE-2009-1377](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1377))

It was discovered that OpenSSL did not properly free memory when processing DTLS fragments. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service via memory resource consumption by sending a large number of crafted requests. ([CVE-2009-1378](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1378))

It was discovered that OpenSSL did not properly handle certain server certificates when processing DTLS packets. A remote DTLS server could cause a denial of service by sending a message containing a specially crafted server certificate. ([CVE-2009-1379](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1379))

It was discovered that OpenSSL did not properly handle a DTLS ChangeCipherSpec packet when it occured before ClientHello. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service by sending a specially crafted request. ([CVE-2009-1386](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1386))

It was discovered that OpenSSL did not properly handle out of sequence DTLS handshake messages. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service by sending a specially crafted request. ([CVE-2009-1387](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1387))
