Original advisory details:

 Aral Yaman discovered a vulnerability in the WebGL engine. An attacker could potentially use this to crash Firefox or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2011-2990](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2989">CVE-2011-2989</a>) Vivekanand Bolajwar discovered a vulnerability in the JavaScript engine. An attacker could potentially use this to crash Firefox or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2991">CVE-2011-2991</a>) Bert Hubert and Theo Snelleman discovered a vulnerability in the Ogg reader. An attacker could potentially use this to crash Firefox or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2991">CVE-2011-2991</a>) Robert Kaiser, Jesse Ruderman, Gary Kwong, Christoph Diehl, Martijn Wargers, Travis Emmitt, Bob Clary, and Jonathan Watt discovered multiple memory vulnerabilities in the browser rendering engine. An attacker could use these to possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2985">CVE-2011-2985</a>) Rafael Gieschke discovered that unsigned JavaScript could call into a script inside a signed JAR. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the identity and permissions of the signed JAR. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2993">CVE-2011-2993</a>) Michael Jordon discovered that an overly long shader program could cause a buffer overrun. An attacker could potentially use this to crash Firefox or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2988">CVE-2011-2988</a>) Michael Jordon discovered a heap overflow in the ANGLE library used in Firefox&#39;s WebGL implementation. An attacker could potentially use this to crash Firefox or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2987">CVE-2011-2987</a>) It was discovered that an SVG text manipulation routine contained a dangling pointer vulnerability. An attacker could potentially use this to crash Firefox or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0084">CVE-2011-0084</a>) Mike Cardwell discovered that Content Security Policy violation reports failed to strip out proxy authorization credentials from the list of request headers. This could allow a malicious website to capture proxy authorization credentials. Daniel Veditz discovered that redirecting to a website with Content Security Policy resulted in the incorrect resolution of hosts in the constructed policy. This could allow a malicious website to circumvent the Content Security Policy of another website. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2990))
