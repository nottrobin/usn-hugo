### puppet regression

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

USN-1223-1 caused a regression with managing SSH authorized_keys files. 

### Software description

* puppet 

### Details

USN-1223-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Puppet. A regression was found on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS that caused permission denied errors when managing SSH authorized_keys files with Puppet. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that Puppet unsafely opened files when the k5login type is used to manage files. A local attacker could exploit this to overwrite arbitrary files which could be used to escalate privileges. ([CVE-2011-3871](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3869">CVE-2011-3869</a>) Ricky Zhou discovered that Puppet did not drop privileges when creating SSH authorized_keys files. A local attacker could exploit this to overwrite arbitrary files as root. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3870">CVE-2011-3870</a>) It was discovered that Puppet used a predictable filename when using the --edit resource. A local attacker could exploit this to edit arbitrary files or run arbitrary code as the user invoking the program, typically root. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3871))
