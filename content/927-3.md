### thunderbird regression

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 9.10

### Software description

* thunderbird 

### Details

USN-927-1 fixed vulnerabilities in NSS. Due to upstream changes in NSS 3.12.6, Thunderbird would be unable to initialize the security component and connect with SSL/TLS if the old libnss3-0d transition package was installed. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Marsh Ray and Steve Dispensa discovered a flaw in the TLS and SSLv3 protocols. If an attacker could perform a man in the middle attack at the start of a TLS connection, the attacker could inject arbitrary content at the beginning of the user&#39;s session. This update adds support for the new new renegotiation extension and will use it when the server supports it. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 9.10
 : [thunderbird](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/thunderbird) <span> [2.0.0.24+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.9.10.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/thunderbird/2.0.0.24+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.9.10.2) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Thunderbird to effect the necessary changes.
