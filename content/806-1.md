    It was discovered that Python incorrectly handled certain arguments in the imageop module. If an attacker were able to pass specially crafted arguments through the crop function, they could execute arbitrary code with user privileges. For Python 2.5, this issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2008-4864](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4864))

### python2.4, python2.5 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* python2.4 

* python2.5 

### Details

It was discovered that Python incorrectly handled certain arguments in the imageop module. If an attacker were able to pass specially crafted arguments through the crop function, they could execute arbitrary code with user privileges. For Python 2.5, this issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2008-4864](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4864))

Multiple integer overflows were discovered in Python&#39;s stringobject and unicodeobject expandtabs method. If an attacker were able to exploit these flaws they could execute arbitrary code with user privileges or cause Python applications to crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-5031](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5031))
