### evince vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.10
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 9.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Software description

* evince 

### Details

Jon Larimer discovered that Evince&#39;s font parsers incorrectly handled certain buffer lengths when rendering a DVI file. By tricking a user into opening or previewing a DVI file that uses a specially crafted font file, an attacker could crash evince or execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges.

In the default installation of Ubuntu 9.10 and later, attackers would be isolated by the Evince AppArmor profile.
