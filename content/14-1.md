### xpdf vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Markus Meissner discovered even more integer overflow vulnerabilities in xpdf, a viewer for PDF files. These integer overflows can eventually lead to buffer overflows.

The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) uses the same code to print PDF files; tetex-bin uses the code to generate PDF output and process included PDF files. In any case, these vulnerabilities could be exploited by an attacker providing a specially crafted PDF file which, when processed by CUPS, xpdf, or pdflatex, could result in abnormal program termination or the execution of program code supplied by the attacker.

In the case of CUPS, this bug could be exploited to gain the privileges of the CUPS print server (by default, user cupsys).

In the cases of xpdf and pdflatex, this bug could be exploited to gain the privileges of the user invoking the program.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 4.10
 : tetex-bin 
 : xpdf-utils 
 : xpdf-reader 
 : cupsys 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).
