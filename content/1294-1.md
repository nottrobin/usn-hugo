### linux-lts-backport-oneiric vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-backport-oneiric 

### Details

 Peter Huewe discovered an information leak in the handling of reading security-related TPM data. A local, unprivileged user could read the results of a previous TPM command. ([CVE-2011-1162](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1162))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that taskstats did not enforce access restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain information, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2011-2494](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2494))

Qianfeng Zhang discovered that the bridge networking interface incorrectly handled certain network packets. A remote attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2942](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2942))

Yasuaki Ishimatsu discovered a flaw in the kernel&#39;s clock implementation. A local unprivileged attacker could exploit this causing a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-3209](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3209))

Zheng Liu discovered a flaw in how the ext4 filesystem splits extents. A local unprivileged attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-3638](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3638))

Scot Doyle discovered that the bridge networking interface incorrectly handled certain network packets. A remote attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-4087](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4087))

A bug was found in the way headroom check was performed in udp6_ufo_fragment() function. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system. ([CVE-2011-4326](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4326))
