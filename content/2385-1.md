    It was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when parsing DTLS SRTP extension data. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

### openssl vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in OpenSSL. 

### Software description

* openssl 

### Details

It was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when parsing DTLS SRTP extension data. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-3513](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3513))

It was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when verifying the integrity of a session ticket. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2014-3567](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3567))

In addition, this update introduces support for the TLS Fallback Signaling Cipher Suite Value (TLS_FALLBACK_SCSV). This new feature prevents protocol downgrade attacks when certain applications such as web browsers attempt to reconnect using a lower protocol version for interoperability reasons. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 : [libssl1.0.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl) <span> [1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.7](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.7) </span> 

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [libssl1.0.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl) <span> [1.0.1-4ubuntu5.20](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/1.0.1-4ubuntu5.20) </span> 

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [libssl0.9.8](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl) <span> [0.9.8k-7ubuntu8.22](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/0.9.8k-7ubuntu8.22) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).
