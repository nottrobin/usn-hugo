### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

 Andy Lutomirski discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s handling of nested NMIs (non-maskable interrupts). An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially escalate their privileges. ([CVE-2015-3290](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-3290))

Colin King discovered a flaw in the add_key function of the Linux kernel&#39;s keyring subsystem. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion). ([CVE-2015-1333](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1333))

Andy Lutomirski discovered a flaw that allows user to cause the Linux kernel to ignore some NMIs (non-maskable interrupts). A local unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to potentially cause the system to miss important NMIs resulting in unspecified effects. ([CVE-2015-3291](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-3291))

Andy Lutomirski and Petr Matousek discovered that an NMI (non-maskable interrupt) that interrupts userspace and encounters an IRET fault is incorrectly handled by the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel OOPs), corruption, or potentially escalate privileges on the system. ([CVE-2015-5157](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-5157)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-59-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.13.0-59.98](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.13.0-59.98) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-59-powerpc-e500mc](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.13.0-59.98](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.13.0-59.98) </span>

 : [linux-image-3.13.0-59-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.13.0-59.98](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.13.0-59.98) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-59-powerpc64-emb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.13.0-59.98](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.13.0-59.98) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
