### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 9.10
 : [libxmlrpc-core-c3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xmlrpc-c) <span> [1.06.27-1ubuntu6.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xmlrpc-c/1.06.27-1ubuntu6.1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart any applications linked against XML-RPC for C and C++ to effect the necessary changes.
