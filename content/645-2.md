A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* firefox 

### Details

USN-645-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox and xulrunner for Ubuntu 7.04, 7.10 and 8.04 LTS. This provides the corresponding update for Ubuntu 6.06 LTS.

Original advisory details:

 Justin Schuh, Tom Cross and Peter Williams discovered errors in the Firefox URL parsing routines. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted hyperlink, an attacker could overflow a stack buffer and execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2008-4069](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0016">CVE-2008-0016</a>) It was discovered that the same-origin check in Firefox could be bypassed. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker may be able to execute JavaScript in the context of a different website. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3835">CVE-2008-3835</a>) Several problems were discovered in the JavaScript engine. This could allow an attacker to execute scripts from page content with chrome privileges. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3836">CVE-2008-3836</a>) Paul Nickerson discovered Firefox did not properly process mouse click events. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could move the content window, which could potentially be used to force a user to perform unintended drag and drop operations. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3837">CVE-2008-3837</a>) Several problems were discovered in the browser engine. This could allow an attacker to execute code with chrome privileges. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4058">CVE-2008-4058</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4059">CVE-2008-4059</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4060">CVE-2008-4060</a>) Drew Yao, David Maciejak and other Mozilla developers found several problems in the browser engine of Firefox. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4061">CVE-2008-4061</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4062">CVE-2008-4062</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4063">CVE-2008-4063</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4064">CVE-2008-4064</a>) Dave Reed discovered a flaw in the JavaScript parsing code when processing certain BOM characters. An attacker could exploit this to bypass script filters and perform cross-site scripting attacks. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4065">CVE-2008-4065</a>) Gareth Heyes discovered a flaw in the HTML parser of Firefox. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could bypass script filtering and perform cross-site scripting attacks. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4066">CVE-2008-4066</a>) Boris Zbarsky and Georgi Guninski independently discovered flaws in the resource: protocol. An attacker could exploit this to perform directory traversal, read information about the system, and prompt the user to save information in a file. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4067">CVE-2008-4067</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4068">CVE-2008-4068</a>) Billy Hoffman discovered a problem in the XBM decoder. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious web page or XBM file, an attacker may be able to cause a denial of service via application crash. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4069)) 

### Update instructions
