    It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel in some situations did not prevent special internal keyrings from being joined by userspace keyrings.

### linux, linux-raspi2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 17.04

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the Linux kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

* linux-raspi2 

### Details

It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel in some situations did not prevent special internal keyrings from being joined by userspace keyrings. A privileged local attacker could use this to bypass module verification. ([CVE-2016-9604](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-9604))

It was discovered that a buffer overflow existed in the trace subsystem in the Linux kernel. A privileged local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-0605](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-0605))

Daniel Jiang discovered that a race condition existed in the ipv4 ping socket implementation in the Linux kernel. A local privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-2671](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-2671))

JongHwan Kim discovered an out-of-bounds read in the TCP stack of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or leak sensitive information. ([CVE-2017-7277](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-7277))

Eric Biggers discovered a memory leak in the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory consumption). ([CVE-2017-7472](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-7472))

Sabrina Dubroca discovered that the asynchronous cryptographic hash (ahash) implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly handle a full request queue. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (infinite recursion). ([CVE-2017-7618](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-7618))

Tuomas Haanpää and Ari Kauppi discovered that the NFSv2 and NFSv3 server implementations in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain long RPC replies. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-7645](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-7645))

Tommi Rantala and Brad Spengler discovered that the memory manager in the Linux kernel did not properly enforce the CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM protection mechanism. A local attacker with access to /dev/mem could use this to expose sensitive information or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-7889](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-7889))

Tuomas Haanpää and Ari Kauppi discovered that the NFSv2 and NFSv3 server implementations in the Linux kernel did not properly check for the end of buffer. A remote attacker could use this to craft requests that cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-7895](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-7895))

Fabian Grünbichler discovered that the Packet action API implementation in the Linux kernel improperly handled uninitialized data. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-7979](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-7979))

It was discovered that the Conexant USB driver in the Linux kernel improperly handled memory in some configurations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-8063](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-8063))

It was discovered that the DVD USB framework in the Linux kernel improperly handled memory in some configurations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-8064](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-8064))

It was discovered that the virtio console driver in the Linux kernel improperly handled memory. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-8067](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-8067)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 17.04
 : linux-image-generic-lpae <span>4.10.0.22.24</span>
 : [linux-image-4.10.0-22-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [4.10.0-22.24](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/4.10.0-22.24) </span> 
 : [linux-image-4.10.0-1006-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-raspi2) <span> [4.10.0-1006.8](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-raspi2/4.10.0-1006.8) </span> 
 : [linux-image-4.10.0-22-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [4.10.0-22.24](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/4.10.0-22.24) </span> 
 : linux-image-generic <span>4.10.0.22.24</span>
 : [linux-image-4.10.0-22-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [4.10.0-22.24](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/4.10.0-22.24) </span> 
 : linux-image-lowlatency <span>4.10.0.22.24</span>
 : linux-image-raspi2 <span>4.10.0.1006.8</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
