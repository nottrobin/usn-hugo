### linux regression

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.10

### Software description

* linux 

* procps 

### Details

Version 2.6.27 of the Linux kernel changed the order of options in TCP headers. While this change was RFC-compliant, it was found that some old routers and consumer DSL modems would not route traffic for these systems when TCP timestamps were enabled. As a workaround, TCP timestamps were disabled via sysctl.

This update restores the previous ordering of TCP options, and reenables TCP timestamps. We apologize for the inconvenience. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 8.10
