### openoffice.org vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.04
* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

The StgCompObjStream::Load() failed to check the validity of a length field in documents. If an attacker tricked a user to open a specially crafted OpenOffice file, this triggered a buffer overflow which could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user opening the document.
