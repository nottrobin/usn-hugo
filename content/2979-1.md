    David Matlack discovered that the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict variable Memory Type Range Registers (MTRR) in KVM guests. A privileged user in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host, expose sensitive information from the host, or possibly gain administrative privileges in the host. ([CVE-2016-3713](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-3713))

### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

David Matlack discovered that the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly restrict variable Memory Type Range Registers (MTRR) in KVM guests. A privileged user in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the host, expose sensitive information from the host, or possibly gain administrative privileges in the host. ([CVE-2016-3713](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-3713))

Philip Pettersson discovered that the Linux kernel&#39;s ASN.1 DER decoder did not properly process certificate files with tags of indefinite length. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-0758](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-0758)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-4.4.0-22-powerpc-e500mc](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [4.4.0-22.40](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/4.4.0-22.40) </span> 
 : [linux-image-4.4.0-22-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [4.4.0-22.40](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/4.4.0-22.40) </span> 
 : [linux-image-4.4.0-22-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [4.4.0-22.40](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/4.4.0-22.40) </span> 
 : [linux-image-4.4.0-22-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [4.4.0-22.40](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/4.4.0-22.40) </span> 
 : [linux-image-4.4.0-22-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [4.4.0-22.40](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/4.4.0-22.40) </span> 
 : [linux-image-4.4.0-22-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [4.4.0-22.40](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/4.4.0-22.40) </span> 
 : [linux-image-4.4.0-22-powerpc64-emb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [4.4.0-22.40](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/4.4.0-22.40) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
