* Ubuntu 7.04
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

### Details

It was discovered that Emacs did not account for precision when formatting integers. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted file, an attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified actions. This issue does not affect Ubuntu 8.04. ([CVE-2007-6109](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-6109))

Steve Grubb discovered that the vcdiff script as included in Emacs created temporary files in an insecure way when used with SCCS. Local users could exploit a race condition to create or overwrite files with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-1694](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-1694))
