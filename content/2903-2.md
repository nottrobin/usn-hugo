### Details

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Hanno BÃ¶ck discovered that NSS incorrectly handled certain division functions, possibly leading to cryptographic weaknesses. ([CVE-2016-1938](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1938)) This update also refreshes the NSS package to version 3.21 which includes the latest CA certificate bundle, and removes the SPI CA. 

### Update instructions
