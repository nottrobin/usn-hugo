Jueri Aedla discovered that libpng did not properly verify the size used when allocating memory during chunk decompression. If a user or automated system using libpng were tricked into opening a specially crafted image, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service or execute code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.
