    Marsh Ray and Steve Dispensa discovered a flaw in the TLS and SSLv3 protocols. If an attacker could perform a man in the middle attack at the start of a TLS connection, the attacker could inject arbitrary content at the beginning of the user&#39;s session. This update adds support for the new new renegotiation extension and will use it when the server supports it.
