    It was discovered that Bind would incorrectly cache bogus NXDOMAIN responses. When DNSSEC validation is in use, a remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service, and possibly poison DNS caches. ([CVE-2010-0097](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-0097))

### bind9 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 9.10
* Ubuntu 9.04
* Ubuntu 8.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* bind9 

### Details

It was discovered that Bind would incorrectly cache bogus NXDOMAIN responses. When DNSSEC validation is in use, a remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service, and possibly poison DNS caches. ([CVE-2010-0097](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-0097))

USN-865-1 provided updated Bind packages to fix a security vulnerability. The upstream security patch to fix [CVE-2010-0290](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-4022">CVE-2009-4022</a> was incomplete and <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-0290) was assigned to the issue. This update corrects the problem. Original advisory details:

 Michael Sinatra discovered that Bind did not correctly validate certain records added to its cache. When DNSSEC validation is in use, a remote attacker could exploit this to spoof DNS entries and poison DNS caches. Among other things, this could lead to misdirected email and web traffic.
