    It was discovered that Blender did not correctly handle certain malformed Radiance RGBE images. If a user were tricked into opening a .blend file containing a specially crafted Radiance RGBE image, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges.

### Details

It was discovered that Blender did not correctly handle certain malformed Radiance RGBE images. If a user were tricked into opening a .blend file containing a specially crafted Radiance RGBE image, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2008-1102](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-1102))

It was discovered that Blender did not properly sanitize the Python search path. A local attacker could execute arbitrary code by inserting a specially crafted Python file in the Blender working directory. ([CVE-2008-4863](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4863))
