### python2.6 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.10
* Ubuntu 11.04
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Python 2.6. 

### Software description

* python2.6 

### Details

It was discovered that Python would prepend an empty string to sys.path under certain circumstances. A local attacker with write access to the current working directory could exploit this to execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2008-5983](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5983))

It was discovered that the audioop module did not correctly perform input validation. If a user or automatated system were tricked into opening a crafted audio file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash. ([CVE-2010-2089](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1634">CVE-2010-1634</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2089))

Giampaolo Rodola discovered several race conditions in the smtpd module. A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via daemon outage. ([CVE-2010-3493](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-3493))

It was discovered that the CGIHTTPServer module did not properly perform input validation on certain HTTP GET requests. A remote attacker could potentially obtain access to CGI script source files. ([CVE-2011-1015](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1015))

Niels Heinen discovered that the urllib and urllib2 modules would process Location headers that specify a redirection to file: URLs. A remote attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04. ([CVE-2011-1521](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1521))

It was discovered that SimpleHTTPServer did not use a charset parameter in the Content-Type HTTP header. An attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against Internet Explorer 7 users. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04. ([CVE-2011-4940](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4940))

It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2011-4944](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4944))

It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization. ([CVE-2012-0845](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0845))

It was discovered that Python was susceptible to hash algorithm attacks. An attacker could cause a denial of service under certian circumstances. This update adds the &#39;-R&#39; command line option and honors setting the PYTHONHASHSEED environment variable to &#39;random&#39; to salt str and datetime objects with an unpredictable value. ([CVE-2012-1150](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1150))
