### Details

USN-1277-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. This update provides updated Mozvoikko and ubufox packages for use with Firefox 8.

Original advisory details:

 Yosuke Hasegawa discovered that the Mozilla browser engine mishandled invalid sequences in the Shift-JIS encoding. It may be possible to trigger this crash without the use of debugging APIs, which might allow malicious websites to exploit this vulnerability. An attacker could possibly use this flaw this to steal data or inject malicious scripts into web content. ([CVE-2011-3655](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3648">CVE-2011-3648</a>) Marc Schoenefeld discovered that using Firebug to profile a JavaScript file with many functions would cause Firefox to crash. An attacker might be able to exploit this without using the debugging APIs, which could potentially remotely crash the browser, resulting in a denial of service. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3650">CVE-2011-3650</a>) Jason Orendorff, Boris Zbarsky, Gregg Tavares, Mats Palmgren, Christian Holler, Jesse Ruderman, Simona Marcu, Bob Clary, and William McCloskey discovered multiple memory safety bugs in the browser engine used in Firefox and other Mozilla-based products. An attacker might be able to use these flaws to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox or possibly crash the browser resulting in a denial of service. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3651">CVE-2011-3651</a>) It was discovered that Firefox could be caused to crash under certain conditions, due to an unchecked allocation failure, resulting in a denial of service. It might also be possible to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3652">CVE-2011-3652</a>) Aki Helin discovered that Firefox does not properly handle links from SVG mpath elements to non-SVG elements. An attacker could use this vulnerability to crash Firefox, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3654">CVE-2011-3654</a>) It was discovered that an internal privilege check failed to respect the NoWaiverWrappers introduced with Firefox 4. An attacker could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges within the browser for web content. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3655))
