### firefox vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.10
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened a malicious website.

### Software description

* firefox 

### Details

Olli Pettay and Boris Zbarsky discovered an issue during anchor navigations in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin policy restrictions. ([CVE-2015-0801](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0801))

Bobby Holley discovered that windows created to hold privileged UI content retained access to privileged internal methods if navigated to unprivileged content. An attacker could potentially exploit this in combination with another flaw, in order to execute arbitrary script in a privileged context. ([CVE-2015-0802](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0802))

Several type confusion issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-0804](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0803">CVE-2015-0803</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0804))

Abhishek Arya discovered memory corruption issues during 2D graphics rendering. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-0806](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0805">CVE-2015-0805</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0806))

Christoph Kerschbaumer discovered that CORS requests from navigator.sendBeacon() followed 30x redirections after preflight. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site request forgery (XSRF) attacks. ([CVE-2015-0807](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0807))

Mitchell Harper discovered an issue with memory management of simple-type arrays in WebRTC. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause undefined behaviour. ([CVE-2015-0808](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0808))

Felix GrÃ¶bert discovered an out-of-bounds read in the QCMS colour management library. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2015-0811](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0811))

Armin Razmdjou discovered that lightweight themes could be installed in Firefox without a user approval message, from Mozilla subdomains over HTTP without SSL. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this by conducting a Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attack to install themes without user approval. ([CVE-2015-0812](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0812))

Aki Helin discovered a use-after-free when playing MP3 audio files using the Fluendo MP3 GStreamer plugin in certain circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-0813](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0813))

Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, Gary Kwong, Karl Tomlinson, Randell Jesup, Shu-yu Guo, Steve Fink, Tooru Fujisawa, and Byron Campen discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-0815](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0814">CVE-2015-0814</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0815))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that documents loaded via resource: URLs (such as PDF.js) could load privileged chrome pages. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this in combination with another flaw, in order to execute arbitrary script in a privileged context. ([CVE-2015-0816](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0816))
