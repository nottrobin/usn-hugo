Please see the following for more information: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.5/en/news-5-5-36.html http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.5/en/news-5-5-37.html http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/cpuapr2014-1972952.html

Additionally, Matthias Reichl discovered that the mysql-5.5 packages were missing the patches applied previously in the mysql-5.1 packages to drop the default test database and localhost permissions granting access to any databases starting with &quot;test_&quot;. This update reintroduces these patches for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 12.10, and Ubuntu 13.10. Existing test databases and permissions will not be modified on upgrade. To manually restrict access for existing installations, please refer to the following:
