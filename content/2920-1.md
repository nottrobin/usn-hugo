### oxide-qt vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 15.10
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Oxide. 

### Software description

* oxide-qt 

### Details

It was discovered that the ContainerNode::parserRemoveChild function in Blink mishandled widget updates in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions. ([CVE-2016-1630](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1630))

It was discovered that the PPB_Flash_MessageLoop_Impl::InternalRun function in Chromium mishandled nested message loops. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions. ([CVE-2016-1631](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1631))

Multiple use-after-frees were discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2016-1644](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1633">CVE-2016-1633</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1634">CVE-2016-1634</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1644))

It was discovered that the PendingScript::notifyFinished function in Blink relied on memory-cache information about integrity-check occurrences instead of integrity-check successes. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass Subresource Integrity (SRI) protections. ([CVE-2016-1636](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1636))

It was discovered that the SkATan2_255 function in Skia mishandled arctangent calculations. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-1637](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1637))

A use-after-free was discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2016-1641](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1641))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2016-1642](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1642))

A type-confusion bug was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2016-1643](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1643))

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2016-2843](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2843))

An invalid cast was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2016-2844](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2844))

It was discovered that the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in Blink did not ignore a URL&#39;s path component in the case of a ServiceWorker fetch. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-2845](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2845))
