### linux-lts-raring vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-raring 

### Details

 Vasily Kulikov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s implementation of ptrace. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2929](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2929))

Dave Jones and Vince Weaver reported a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s per event subsystem that allows normal users to enable function tracing. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from the kernel. ([CVE-2013-2930](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2930))

Jason Wang discovered a bug in the network flow dissector in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (infinite loop). ([CVE-2013-4348](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4348))

A flaw in the handling of memory regions of the kernel virtual machine (KVM) subsystem was discovered. A local user with the ability to assign a device could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory consumption). ([CVE-2013-4592](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4592))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s debugfs filesystem. An administrative local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (OOPS). ([CVE-2013-6378](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-6378)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.8.0-36-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-raring) <span> [3.8.0-36.52~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-raring/3.8.0-36.52~precise1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
