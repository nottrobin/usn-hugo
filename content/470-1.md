### linux-source-2.6.20 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 7.04

### Details

USN-464-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel. Some additional code changes were accidentally included in the Feisty update which caused trouble for some people who were not using UUID-based filesystem mounts. These changes have been reverted. We apologize for the inconvenience. For more information see: https://launchpad.net/bugs/117314 https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UsingUUID

Ilja van Sprundel discovered that Bluetooth setsockopt calls could leak kernel memory contents via an uninitialized stack buffer. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to view sensitive kernel information. ([CVE-2007-1353](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-1353))

The GEODE-AES driver did not correctly initialize its encryption key. Any data encrypted using this type of device would be easily compromised. ([CVE-2007-2451](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2451))

The random number generator was hashing a subset of the available entropy, leading to slightly less random numbers. Additionally, systems without an entropy source would be seeded with the same inputs at boot time, leading to a repeatable series of random numbers. ([CVE-2007-2453](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2453))
