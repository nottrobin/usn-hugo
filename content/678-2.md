A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.10

* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* gnutls12

### Details

USN-678-1 fixed a vulnerability in GnuTLS. The upstream patch introduced a regression when validating certain certificate chains that would report valid certificates as untrusted. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Martin von Gagern discovered that GnuTLS did not properly verify certificate chains when the last certificate in the chain was self-signed. If a remote attacker were able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive information. ([CVE-2008-4989](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4989))
