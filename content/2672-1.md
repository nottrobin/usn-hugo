    Karthikeyan Bhargavan discovered that NSS incorrectly handled state transitions for the TLS state machine. If a remote attacker were able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to skip the ServerKeyExchange message and remove the forward-secrecy property.

### nss vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 15.04
* Ubuntu 14.10
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in NSS. 

### Software description

* nss 

### Details

Karthikeyan Bhargavan discovered that NSS incorrectly handled state transitions for the TLS state machine. If a remote attacker were able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to skip the ServerKeyExchange message and remove the forward-secrecy property. ([CVE-2015-2721](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2721))

Watson Ladd discovered that NSS incorrectly handled Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC) multiplication. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to spoof ECDSA signatures. ([CVE-2015-2730](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2730))

As a security improvement, this update modifies NSS behaviour to reject DH key sizes below 768 bits, preventing a possible downgrade attack.

This update also refreshes the NSS package to version 3.19.2 which includes the latest CA certificate bundle. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 15.04
 : [libnss3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nss) <span> [2:3.19.2-0ubuntu15.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nss/2:3.19.2-0ubuntu15.04.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 14.10
 : [libnss3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nss) <span> [2:3.19.2-0ubuntu0.14.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nss/2:3.19.2-0ubuntu0.14.10.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 : [libnss3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nss) <span> [2:3.19.2-0ubuntu0.14.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nss/2:3.19.2-0ubuntu0.14.04.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [libnss3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nss) <span> [3.19.2-0ubuntu0.12.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nss/3.19.2-0ubuntu0.12.04.1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

This update uses a new upstream release, which includes additional bug fixes. After a standard system update you need to restart any applications that use NSS, such as Evolution and Chromium, to make all the necessary changes.
