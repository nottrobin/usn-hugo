### nss regression

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 9.10

### Software description

* nss 

### Details

USN-927-1 fixed vulnerabilities in NSS. Upstream NSS 3.12.6 added an additional checksum verification on libnssdbm3.so, but the Ubuntu packaging did not create this checksum. As a result, Firefox could not initialize the security component when the NSS Internal FIPS PKCS #11 Module was enabled. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Marsh Ray and Steve Dispensa discovered a flaw in the TLS and SSLv3 protocols. If an attacker could perform a man in the middle attack at the start of a TLS connection, the attacker could inject arbitrary content at the beginning of the user&#39;s session. This update adds support for the new new renegotiation extension and will use it when the server supports it. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 9.10
 : [libnss3-1d](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nss) <span> [3.12.6-0ubuntu0.9.10.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nss/3.12.6-0ubuntu0.9.10.2) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart your session to effect the necessary changes.
