    It was discovered that the CUPS administration interface contained a heap- based overflow flaw. A local attacker, and a remote attacker if printer sharing is enabled, could send a malicious request and possibly execute arbitrary code as the non-root user in Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 6.10, and 7.04. In Ubuntu 7.10, attackers would be isolated by the AppArmor CUPS profile. ([CVE-2008-0047](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0047))

### cupsys vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 7.10
* Ubuntu 7.04
* Ubuntu 6.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* cupsys 

### Details

It was discovered that the CUPS administration interface contained a heap- based overflow flaw. A local attacker, and a remote attacker if printer sharing is enabled, could send a malicious request and possibly execute arbitrary code as the non-root user in Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 6.10, and 7.04. In Ubuntu 7.10, attackers would be isolated by the AppArmor CUPS profile. ([CVE-2008-0047](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0047))

It was discovered that the hpgl filter in CUPS did not properly validate its input when parsing parameters. If a crafted HP-GL/2 file were printed, an attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code as the non-root user in Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 6.10, and 7.04. In Ubuntu 7.10, attackers would be isolated by the AppArmor CUPS profile. ([CVE-2008-0053](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0053))

It was discovered that CUPS had a flaw in its managing of remote shared printers via IPP. A remote attacker could send a crafted UDP packet and cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code as the non-root user in Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 6.10, and 7.04. In Ubuntu 7.10, attackers would be isolated by the AppArmor CUPS profile. ([CVE-2008-0882](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0882))

It was discovered that CUPS did not properly perform bounds checking in its GIF decoding routines. If a crafted GIF file were printed, an attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code as the non-root user in Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 6.10, and 7.04. In Ubuntu 7.10, attackers would be isolated by the AppArmor CUPS profile. ([CVE-2008-1373](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-1373)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:
