    Jack Louis of Dyad Security discovered that Perl did not sufficiently check the explicit length argument in format strings. Specially crafted format strings with overly large length arguments led to a crash of the Perl interpreter or even to execution of arbitrary attacker-defined code with the privileges of the user running the Perl program.

### perl vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04
* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Jack Louis of Dyad Security discovered that Perl did not sufficiently check the explicit length argument in format strings. Specially crafted format strings with overly large length arguments led to a crash of the Perl interpreter or even to execution of arbitrary attacker-defined code with the privileges of the user running the Perl program.

However, this attack was only possible in insecure Perl programs which use variables with user-defined values in string interpolations without checking their validity.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 5.10
 : perl-base 

Ubuntu 5.04
 : perl-base 

Ubuntu 4.10
 : perl-base 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

None
