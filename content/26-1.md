### bogofilter vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho discovered a Denial of Service vulnerability in bogofilter. The quoted-printable decoder handled certain Base-64 encoded strings in an invalid way which caused a buffer overflow and an immediate program abort.

The exact impact depends on the way bogofilter is integrated into the system. In common setups, the mail that contains such malformed headers is deferred by the mail delivery agent and remains in the queue, where it will eventually bounce back to the sender.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 4.10
 : bogofilter 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).
