### linux-raspi2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-raspi2 

### Details

Pengfei Wang discovered a race condition in the audit subsystem in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to corrupt audit logs or disrupt system-call auditing. ([CVE-2016-6136](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-6136))

It was discovered that the powerpc and powerpc64 hypervisor-mode KVM implementation in the Linux kernel for did not properly maintain state about transactional memory. An unprivileged attacker in a guest could cause a denial of service (CPU lockup) in the host OS. ([CVE-2016-5412](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5412))

Pengfei Wang discovered a race condition in the Chrome OS embedded controller device driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-6156](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-6156)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-4.4.0-1023-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-raspi2) <span> [4.4.0-1023.29](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-raspi2/4.4.0-1023.29) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
