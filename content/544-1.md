    Samba developers discovered that nmbd could be made to overrun a buffer during the processing of GETDC logon server requests.  When samba is configured as a Primary or Backup Domain Controller, a remote attacker could send malicious logon requests and possibly cause a denial of service.

Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research discovered that nmbd did not properly check the length of netbios packets. When samba is configured as a WINS server, a remote attacker could send multiple crafted requests resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with root privileges.
