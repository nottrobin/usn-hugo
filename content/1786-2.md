Original advisory details:

 Olli Pettay, Jesse Ruderman, Boris Zbarsky, Christian Holler, Milan Sreckovic, Joe Drew, Andrew McCreight, Randell Jesup, Gary Kwong and Mats Palmgren discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0800](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0788">CVE-2013-0788</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0789">CVE-2013-0789</a>) Ambroz Bizjak discovered an out-of-bounds array read in the CERT_DecodeCertPackage function of the Network Security Services (NSS) libary when decoding certain certificates. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0791">CVE-2013-0791</a>) Tobias Schula discovered an information leak in Firefox when the gfx.color_management.enablev4 preference is enabled. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted image, an attacker could potentially exploit this to steal confidential data. By default, the gfx.color_management.enablev4 preference is not enabled in Ubuntu. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0792">CVE-2013-0792</a>) Mariusz Mlynski discovered that timed history navigations could be used to load arbitrary websites with the wrong URL displayed in the addressbar. An attacker could exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) or phishing attacks. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0793">CVE-2013-0793</a>) It was discovered that the origin indication on tab-modal dialog boxes could be removed, which could allow an attacker&#39;s dialog to be displayed over another sites content. An attacker could exploit this to conduct phishing attacks. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0794">CVE-2013-0794</a>) Cody Crews discovered that the cloneNode method could be used to bypass System Only Wrappers (SOW) to clone a protected node and bypass same-origin policy checks. An attacker could potentially exploit this to steal confidential data or execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0795">CVE-2013-0795</a>) A crash in WebGL rendering was discovered in Firefox. An attacker could potentially exploit this to execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. This issue only affects users with Intel graphics drivers. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0796">CVE-2013-0796</a>) Abhishek Arya discovered an out-of-bounds write in the Cairo graphics library. An attacker could potentially exploit this to execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0800))
