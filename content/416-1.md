    Mark Dowd discovered that the netfilter iptables module did not correcly handle fragmented IPv6 packets.

This has has already been fixed for Ubuntu 6.10 in USN-395-1; this is the corresponding fix for Ubuntu 6.06.([CVE-2006-4572](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4572))

### linux-source-2.6.12/2.6.15/2.6.17 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
* Ubuntu 5.10

### Details

Mark Dowd discovered that the netfilter iptables module did not correcly handle fragmented IPv6 packets. By sending specially crafted packets, a remote attacker could exploit this to bypass firewall rules. This has has already been fixed for Ubuntu 6.10 in USN-395-1; this is the corresponding fix for Ubuntu 6.06.([CVE-2006-4572](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4572))

Doug Chapman discovered an improper lock handling in the mincore() function. A local attacker could exploit this to cause an eternal hang in the kernel, rendering the machine unusable. ([CVE-2006-4814](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4814))

Al Viro reported that the ISDN PPP module did not initialize the reset state timer. By sending specially crafted ISDN packets, a remote attacker could exploit this to crash the kernel. ([CVE-2006-5749](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-5749))

Various syscalls (like listxattr()) misinterpreted the return value of return_EIO() when encountering bad inodes. By issuing particular system calls on a malformed file system, a local attacker could exploit this to crash the kernel. ([CVE-2006-5753](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-5753))

The task switching code did not save and restore EFLAGS of processes. By starting a specially crafted executable, a local attacker could exploit this to eventually crash many other running processes. This only affects the amd64 platform. ([CVE-2006-5755](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-5755))

A race condition was found in the grow_buffers() function. By mounting a specially crafted ISO9660 or NTFS file system, a local attacker could exploit this to trigger an infinite loop in the kernel, rendering the machine unusable. ([CVE-2006-5757](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-5757))

A buffer overread was found in the zlib_inflate() function. By tricking an user into mounting a specially crafted file system which uses zlib compression (such as cramfs), this could be exploited to crash the kernel. ([CVE-2006-5823](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-5823))

The ext3 file system driver did not properly handle corrupted data structures. By mounting a specially crafted ext3 file system, a local attacker could exploit this to crash the kernel. ([CVE-2006-6053](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-6053))

The ext2 file system driver did not properly handle corrupted data structures. By mounting a specially crafted ext2 file system, a local attacker could exploit this to crash the kernel. ([CVE-2006-6054](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-6054))

The hfs file system driver did not properly handle corrupted data structures. By mounting a specially crafted hfs file system, a local attacker could exploit this to crash the kernel. This only affects systems which enable SELinux (Ubuntu disables SELinux by default). ([CVE-2006-6056](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-6056))

Several vulnerabilities have been found in the GFS2 file system driver. Since this driver has never actually worked in Ubuntu 6.10, it has been disabled. This only affects Ubuntu 6.10. ([CVE-2006-6057](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-6057))

Marcel Holtman discovered several buffer overflows in the Bluetooth driver. By sending Bluetooth packets with specially crafted CAPI messages, a remote attacker could exploit these to crash the kernel. ([CVE-2006-6106](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-6106))

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the Ubuntu 6.06 and Ubuntu 6.10 kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (linux-386, linux-powerpc, linux-amd64-generic), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
