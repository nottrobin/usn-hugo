### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

The system could be made to expose sensitive information. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the procfs environ_read function in the Linux kernel, leading to an integer underflow. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-1497-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [3.2.0-1497.124](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1497.124) </span> 
 : [linux-image-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [3.2.0.1497.92](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1497.124) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
