### firefox vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Details

Various flaws have been reported that allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with user privileges by tricking the user into opening a malicious URL. ([CVE-2006-3812](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3113">CVE-2006-3113</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3677">CVE-2006-3677</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3801">CVE-2006-3801</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3803">CVE-2006-3803</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3805">CVE-2006-3805</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3806">CVE-2006-3806</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3807">CVE-2006-3807</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3809">CVE-2006-3809</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3811">CVE-2006-3811</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3812))

cross-site scripting vulnerabilities were found in the XPCNativeWrapper() function and native DOM method handlers. A malicious web site could exploit these to modify the contents or steal confidential data (such as passwords) from other opened web pages. ([CVE-2006-3810](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3802">CVE-2006-3802</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3810))

A bug was found in the script handler for automatic proxy configuration. A malicious proxy could send scripts which could execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2006-3808](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3808))

Please see

for technical details of these vulnerabilities.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : firefox <span>1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.5-0ubuntu6.06</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Firefox to effect the necessary changes.

Please note that Firefox 1.0.8 in Ubuntu 5.10 and Ubuntu 5.04 are also affected by these problems. Updates for these Ubuntu releases will be delayed due to upstream dropping support for this Firefox version. We strongly advise that you disable JavaScript to disable the attack vectors for most vulnerabilities if you use one of these Ubuntu versions.
