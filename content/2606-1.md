### openssl update

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

OpenSSL TLSv1.2 client support has been enabled in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. 

### Software description

* openssl 

### Details

For compatibility reasons, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS shipped OpenSSL with TLSv1.2 disabled when being used as a client.

This update re-enables TLSv1.2 by default now that the majority of problematic sites have been updated to fix compatibility issues.

For problematic environments, TLSv1.2 can be disabled again by setting the OPENSSL_NO_CLIENT_TLS1_2 environment variable before library initialization. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [libssl1.0.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl) <span> [1.0.1-4ubuntu5.27](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/1.0.1-4ubuntu5.27) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.
