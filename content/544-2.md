    USN-544-1 fixed two vulnerabilities in Samba.

Additionally, Dapper and Edgy included an incomplete patch which caused configurations using NetBIOS to fail. A proper fix for these regressions does not exist at this time, and so the patch addressing <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-4572) has been removed. This vulnerability is believed to be an unexploitable denial of service, but a future update will address this issue. We apologize for the inconvenience.

### Details

USN-544-1 fixed two vulnerabilities in Samba. Fixes for [CVE-2007-4572](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-5398">CVE-2007-5398</a> are unchanged, but the upstream changes for <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-4572">CVE-2007-4572</a> introduced a regression in all releases which caused Linux smbfs mounts to fail. Additionally, Dapper and Edgy included an incomplete patch which caused configurations using NetBIOS to fail. A proper fix for these regressions does not exist at this time, and so the patch addressing <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-4572) has been removed. This vulnerability is believed to be an unexploitable denial of service, but a future update will address this issue. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Samba developers discovered that nmbd could be made to overrun a buffer during the processing of GETDC logon server requests. When samba is configured as a Primary or Backup Domain Controller, a remote attacker could send malicious logon requests and possibly cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-4572](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-4572))

 Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research discovered that nmbd did not properly check the length of netbios packets. When samba is configured as a WINS server, a remote attacker could send multiple crafted requests resulting in the execution of arbitrary code with root privileges. ([CVE-2007-5398](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-5398))
