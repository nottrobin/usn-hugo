### linux-lts-raring vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-raring 

### Details

 Chanam Park reported a Null pointer flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s Ceph client. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-1059](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1059))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s fanotify interface. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2148](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2148))

Jonathan Salwan discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel&#39;s cdrom driver. A local user can exploit this leak to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory if the CD-ROM drive is malfunctioning. ([CVE-2013-2164](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2164))

Kees Cook discovered a format string vulnerability in the Linux kernel&#39;s disk block layer. A local user with administrator privileges could exploit this flaw to gain kernel privileges. ([CVE-2013-2851](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2851))

Kees Cook discovered a format string vulnerability in the Broadcom B43 wireless driver for the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-2852](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2852))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered that the Linux kernel&#39;s IPv6 stack does not correctly handle Router Advertisement (RA) message in some cases. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4125](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4125))

A vulnerability was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s vhost net driver. A local user could cause a denial of service (system crash) by powering on a virtual machine. ([CVE-2013-4127](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4127))

Marcus Moeller and Ken Fallon discovered that the CIFS incorrectly built certain paths. A local attacker with access to a CIFS partition could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-4247](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4247)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.8.0-29-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-raring) <span> [3.8.0-29.42~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-raring/3.8.0-29.42~precise1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
