### linux-lts-quantal vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-quantal 

### Details

 A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s dm snapshot facility. A remote authenticated user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information or modify/corrupt data. ([CVE-2013-4299](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4299))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO). An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4470](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4470))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s SIOCWANDEV ioctl call. A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1444](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1444))

An information leak was discovered in the wanxl ioctl function the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1445](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1445)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-44-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-quantal) <span> [3.5.0-44.67~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-quantal/3.5.0-44.67~precise1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
