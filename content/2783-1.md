### ntp vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 15.10
* Ubuntu 15.04
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in NTP. 

### Software description

* ntp 

### Details

Aleksis Kauppinen discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain remote config packets. In a non-default configuration, a remote authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-5146](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-5146))

Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled logconfig directives. In a non-default configuration, a remote authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-5194](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-5194))

Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain statistics types. In a non-default configuration, a remote authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-5195](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-5195))

Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain file paths. In a non-default configuration, a remote authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or overwrite certain files. ([CVE-2015-7703](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-5196">CVE-2015-5196</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7703))

Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to hang, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-5219](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-5219))

Aanchal Malhotra, Isaac E. Cohen, and Sharon Goldberg discovered that NTP incorrectly handled restarting after hitting a panic threshold. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to alter the system time on clients. ([CVE-2015-5300](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-5300))

It was discovered that NTP incorrectly handled autokey data packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-7702](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7691">CVE-2015-7691</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7692">CVE-2015-7692</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7702))

It was discovered that NTP incorrectly handled memory when processing certain autokey messages. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to consume memory, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-7701](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7701))

Aanchal Malhotra, Isaac E. Cohen, and Sharon Goldberg discovered that NTP incorrectly handled rate limiting. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause clients to stop updating their clock. ([CVE-2015-7705](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7704">CVE-2015-7704</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7705))

Yves Younan discovered that NTP incorrectly handled logfile and keyfile directives. In a non-default configuration, a remote authenticated attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to enter a loop, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-7850](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7850))

Yves Younan and Aleksander Nikolich discovered that NTP incorrectly handled ascii conversion. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-7852](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7852))

Yves Younan discovered that NTP incorrectly handled reference clock memory. A malicious refclock could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-7853](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7853))

John D &quot;Doug&quot; Birdwell discovered that NTP incorrectly handled decoding certain bogus values. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-7855](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7855))

Stephen Gray discovered that NTP incorrectly handled symmetric association authentication. A remote attacker could use this issue to possibly bypass authentication and alter the system clock. ([CVE-2015-7871](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7871))

In the default installation, attackers would be isolated by the NTP AppArmor profile. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 15.10
 : [ntp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ntp) <span> [1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-3ubuntu8.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ntp/1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-3ubuntu8.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 15.04
 : [ntp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ntp) <span> [1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-3ubuntu6.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ntp/1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-3ubuntu6.2) </span> 

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 : [ntp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ntp) <span> [1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-3ubuntu2.14.04.5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ntp/1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-3ubuntu2.14.04.5) </span> 

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [ntp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ntp) <span> [1:4.2.6.p3+dfsg-1ubuntu3.6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ntp/1:4.2.6.p3+dfsg-1ubuntu3.6) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
