    Simon Ruderich discovered that APT incorrectly handled repositories that use InRelease files. The default Ubuntu repositories do not use InRelease files, so this issue only affected third-party repositories. If a remote attacker were able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could potentially be used to install altered packages.
