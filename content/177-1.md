### apache2, libapache-mod-ssl vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.04
* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Apache did not honour the &quot;SSLVerifyClient require&quot; directive within a &lt;Location&gt; block if the surrounding &lt;VirtualHost&gt; block contained a directive &quot;SSLVerifyClient optional&quot;. This allowed clients to bypass client certificate validation on servers with the above configuration. (CAN-2005-2700)

Filip Sneppe discovered a Denial of Service vulnerability in the byte range filter handler. By requesting certain large byte ranges, a remote attacker could cause memory exhaustion in the server. (CAN-2005-2728)

The updated libapache-mod-ssl also fixes two older Denial of Service vulnerabilities: A format string error in the ssl_log() function which could be exploited to crash the server (CAN-2004-0700), and a flaw in the SSL cipher negotiation which could be exploited to terminate a session (CAN-2004-0885). Please note that Apache 1.3 and libapache-mod-ssl are not officially supported (they are in the &quot;universe&quot; component of the Ubuntu archive).

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 5.04
 : apache2-mpm-worker 
 : apache2-mpm-perchild 
 : apache2-mpm-threadpool 
 : apache2-mpm-prefork 
 : libapache-mod-ssl 

Ubuntu 4.10
 : apache2-mpm-worker 
 : apache2-mpm-perchild 
 : apache2-mpm-threadpool 
 : apache2-mpm-prefork 
 : libapache-mod-ssl 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).
