### qt4-x11 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 9.04
* Ubuntu 8.10

### Software description

* qt4-x11 

### Details

It was discovered that QtWebKit did not properly handle certain SVGPathList data structures. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website, an attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-0945](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0945))

Several flaws were discovered in the QtWebKit browser and JavaScript engines. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-1725](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1687">CVE-2009-1687</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1690">CVE-2009-1690</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1698">CVE-2009-1698</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1711">CVE-2009-1711</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1725))

It was discovered that QtWebKit did not properly handle certain XSL stylesheets. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website, an attacker could exploit this to read arbitrary local files, and possibly files from different security zones. ([CVE-2009-1713](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1699">CVE-2009-1699</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1713))

It was discovered that QtWebKit did not prevent the loading of local Java applets. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website, an attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-1712](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1712))
