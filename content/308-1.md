    Ilja van Sprundel discovered that passwd, when called with the -f, -g, or -s option, did not check the result of the setuid() call. On systems that configure PAM limits for the maximum number of user processes, a local attacker could exploit this to execute chfn, gpasswd, or chsh with root privileges.

### shadow vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04

### Details

Ilja van Sprundel discovered that passwd, when called with the -f, -g, or -s option, did not check the result of the setuid() call. On systems that configure PAM limits for the maximum number of user processes, a local attacker could exploit this to execute chfn, gpasswd, or chsh with root privileges.

This does not affect the default configuration of Ubuntu.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : passwd <span>1:4.0.13-7ubuntu3.1</span>

Ubuntu 5.10
 : passwd <span>1:4.0.3-37ubuntu10</span>

Ubuntu 5.04
 : passwd <span>1:4.0.3-30.7ubuntu16.1</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the necessary changes.
