### linux-lts-utopic vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-utopic 

### Details

Justin Yackoski discovered that the Atheros L2 Ethernet Driver in the Linux kernel incorrectly enables scatter/gather I/O. A remote attacker could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-2117](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2117))

Jann Horn discovered that eCryptfs improperly attempted to use the mmap() handler of a lower filesystem that did not implement one, causing a recursive page fault to occur. A local unprivileged attacker could use to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-1583](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1583))

Jason A. Donenfeld discovered multiple out-of-bounds reads in the OZMO USB over wifi device drivers in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2015-4004](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-4004))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Linux kernel&#39;s GTCO digitizer USB device driver did not properly validate endpoint descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2187](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2187))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the MCT USB RS232 Converter device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3136](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-3136))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Cypress M8 USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3137](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-3137))

Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Linux kernel&#39;s USB driver for Digi AccelePort serial converters did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3140](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-3140))

Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll discovered that the Linux kernel would improperly disable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) for x86 processes running in 32 bit mode if stack-consumption resource limits were disabled. A local attacker could use this to make it easier to exploit an existing vulnerability in a setuid/setgid program. ([CVE-2016-3672](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-3672))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel&#39;s USB driver for IMS Passenger Control Unit devices did not properly validate the device&#39;s interfaces. An attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3689](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-3689))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the CDC Network Control Model USB driver in the Linux kernel did not cancel work events queued if a later error occurred, resulting in a use-after-free. An attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3951](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-3951))

It was discovered that an out-of-bounds write could occur when handling incoming packets in the USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-3955](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-3955))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 Support implementations in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-4485](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4485))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the routing netlink socket interface (rtnetlink) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-4486](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4486))

It was discovered that in some situations the Linux kernel did not handle propagated mounts correctly. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4581](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4581)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
