### kvm vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Software description

* kvm 

### Details

Avi Kivity discovered that KVM did not correctly handle certain disk formats. A local attacker could attach a malicious partition that would allow the guest VM to read files on the VM host. ([CVE-2008-2004](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-1945">CVE-2008-1945</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2004))

Alfredo Ortega discovered that KVM&#39;s VNC protocol handler did not correctly validate certain messages. A remote attacker could send specially crafted VNC messages that would cause KVM to consume CPU resources, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-2382](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2382))

Jan Niehusmann discovered that KVM&#39;s Cirrus VGA implementation over VNC did not correctly handle certain bitblt operations. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to potentially execute arbitrary code on the VM host or crash KVM, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-4539](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4539))

It was discovered that KVM&#39;s VNC password checks did not use the correct length. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause KVM to crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-5714](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5714)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 8.10
 : [kvm](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kvm) <span> [1:72+dfsg-1ubuntu6.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kvm/1:72+dfsg-1ubuntu6.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
 : [kvm](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kvm) <span> [1:62+dfsg-0ubuntu8.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/kvm/1:62+dfsg-0ubuntu8.1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart all KVM VMs to effect the necessary changes.
