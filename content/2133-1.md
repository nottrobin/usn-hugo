### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

 Mathy Vanhoef discovered an error in the the way the ath9k driver was handling the BSSID masking. A remote attacker could exploit this error to discover the original MAC address after a spoofing atack. ([CVE-2013-4579](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4579))

Andrew Honig reported an error in the Linux Kernel&#39;s Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) VAPIC synchronization operation. A local user could exploit this flaw to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-6368](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-6368))

A flaw was discovered in the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol implementation in the Linux kernel for systems that lack RDS transports. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-7339](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-7339))

halfdog reported an error in the AMD K7 and K8 platform support in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw on AMD based systems to cause a denial of service (task kill) or possibly gain privileges via a crafted application. ([CVE-2014-1438](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1438))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s hamradio YAM driver for AX.25 packet radio. A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1446](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1446))

Matthew Thode reported a denial of service vulnerability in the Linux kernel when SELinux support is enabled. A local user with the CAP_MAC_ADMIN capability (and the SELinux mac_admin permission if running in enforcing mode) could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel crash). ([CVE-2014-1874](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1874)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-60-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-60.91](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-60.91) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-60-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-60.91](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-60.91) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-60-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-60.91](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-60.91) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-60-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-60.91](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-60.91) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-60-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-60.91](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-60.91) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-60-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-60.91](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-60.91) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-60-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-60.91](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-60.91) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
