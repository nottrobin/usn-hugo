    Paul Jakma discovered that Quagga&#39;s ripd daemon did not properly handle authentication of RIPv1 requests. If the RIPv1 protocol had been disabled, or authentication for RIPv2 had been enabled, ripd still replied to RIPv1 requests, which could lead to information disclosure. ([CVE-2006-2223](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-2223))

### quagga vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04

### Details

Paul Jakma discovered that Quagga&#39;s ripd daemon did not properly handle authentication of RIPv1 requests. If the RIPv1 protocol had been disabled, or authentication for RIPv2 had been enabled, ripd still replied to RIPv1 requests, which could lead to information disclosure. ([CVE-2006-2223](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-2223))

Paul Jakma also noticed that ripd accepted unauthenticated RIPv1 response packets if RIPv2 was configured to require authentication and both protocols were allowed. A remote attacker could exploit this to inject arbitrary routes. ([CVE-2006-2224](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-2224))

Fredrik Widell discovered that Quagga did not properly handle certain invalid &#39;sh ip bgp&#39; commands. By sending special commands to Quagga, a remote attacker with telnet access to the Quagga server could exploit this to trigger an endless loop in the daemon (Denial of Service). ([CVE-2006-2276](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-2276))
