*29 July 2006*

### mozilla-thunderbird vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Details

Various flaws have been reported that allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with user privileges by tricking the user into opening a malicious email containing JavaScript. Please note that JavaScript is disabled by default for emails, and it is not recommended to enable it. ([CVE-2006-3812](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3113">CVE-2006-3113</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3802">CVE-2006-3802</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3803">CVE-2006-3803</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3805">CVE-2006-3805</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3806">CVE-2006-3806</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3807">CVE-2006-3807</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3809">CVE-2006-3809</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3810">CVE-2006-3810</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3811">CVE-2006-3811</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3812))

A buffer overflow has been discovered in the handling of .vcard files. By tricking a user into importing a malicious vcard into his contacts, this could be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2006-3084](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3084))

The &quot;enigmail&quot; plugin has been updated to work with the new Thunderbird version.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : mozilla-thunderbird <span>1.5.0.5-0ubuntu0.6.06</span>
 : mozilla-thunderbird-enigmail <span>2:0.94-0ubuntu4.2</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Thunderbird to effect the necessary changes.

Please note that Thunderbird 1.0.8 in Ubuntu 5.10 and Ubuntu 5.04 are also affected by these problems. Updates for these Ubuntu releases will be delayed due to upstream dropping support for this Thunderbird version. We strongly advise that you disable JavaScript to disable the attack vectors for most vulnerabilities if you use one of these Ubuntu versions.
