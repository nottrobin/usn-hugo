    Dan Rosenberg discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in Lynx. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. ([CVE-2010-2810](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2810))

### lynx-cur vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.10
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 11.10
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Two security issues were fixed in Lynx. 

### Software description

* lynx-cur 

### Details

Dan Rosenberg discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in Lynx. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. ([CVE-2010-2810](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2810))

It was discovered that Lynx did not properly verify that an HTTPS certificate was signed by a trusted certificate authority. This could allow an attacker to perform a &quot;man in the middle&quot; (MITM) attack which would make the user believe their connection is secure, but is actually being monitored. This update changes the behavior of Lynx such that self-signed certificates no longer validate. Users requiring the previous behavior can use the &#39;FORCE_SSL_PROMPT&#39; option in lynx.cfg. ([CVE-2012-5821](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5821))
