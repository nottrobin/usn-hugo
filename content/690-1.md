### firefox-3.0, xulrunner-1.9 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Software description

* firefox-3.0 

* xulrunner-1.9 

### Details

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine. These problems could allow an attacker to crash the browser and possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-5502](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5500">CVE-2008-5500</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5501">CVE-2008-5501</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5502))

It was discovered that Firefox did not properly handle persistent cookie data. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker could write persistent data in the user&#39;s browser and track the user across browsing sessions. ([CVE-2008-5505](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5505))

Marius Schilder discovered that Firefox did not properly handle redirects to an outside domain when an XMLHttpRequest was made to a same-origin resource. It&#39;s possible that sensitive information could be revealed in the XMLHttpRequest response. ([CVE-2008-5506](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5506))

Chris Evans discovered that Firefox did not properly protect a user&#39;s data when accessing a same-domain Javascript URL that is redirected to an unparsable Javascript off-site resource. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker may be able to steal a limited amount of private data. ([CVE-2008-5507](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5507))

Chip Salzenberg, Justin Schuh, Tom Cross, and Peter William discovered Firefox did not properly parse URLs when processing certain control characters. ([CVE-2008-5508](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5508))

Kojima Hajime discovered that Firefox did not properly handle an escaped null character. An attacker may be able to exploit this flaw to bypass script sanitization. ([CVE-2008-5510](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5510))

Several flaws were discovered in the Javascript engine. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary Javascript code within the context of another website or with chrome privileges. ([CVE-2008-5512](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5511">CVE-2008-5511</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5512))

Flaws were discovered in the session-restore feature of Firefox. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker could exploit this to perform cross-site scripting attacks or execute arbitrary Javascript code with chrome privileges. ([CVE-2008-5513](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5513))
