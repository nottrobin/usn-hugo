    It was discovered that the mod_negotiation module incorrectly handled certain filenames, which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks when processing the output. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing server output during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data (such as passwords), within the same domain.

### apache2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.10
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 11.10
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the Apache HTTP server. 

### Software description

* apache2 

### Details

It was discovered that the mod_negotiation module incorrectly handled certain filenames, which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks when processing the output. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing server output during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data (such as passwords), within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-2687](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2687))

It was discovered that the Apache HTTP Server was vulnerable to the &quot;CRIME&quot; SSL data compression attack. Although this issue had been mitigated on the client with newer web browsers, this update also disables SSL data compression on the server. A new SSLCompression directive for Apache has been backported that may be used to re-enable SSL data compression in certain environments. For more information, please refer to: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_ssl.html#sslcompression ([CVE-2012-4929](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4929))
