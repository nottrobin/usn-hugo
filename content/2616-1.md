### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.10

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

Alexandre Oliva reported a race condition flaw in the btrfs file system&#39;s handling of extended attributes (xattrs). A local attacker could exploit this flaw to bypass ACLs and potentially escalate privileges. ([CVE-2014-9710](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-9710))

A memory corruption issue was discovered in AES decryption when using the Intel AES-NI accelerated code path. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially escalate privileges on Intel base machines with AEC-GCM mode IPSec security association. ([CVE-2015-3331](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-3331))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s IPv4 networking when using TCP fast open to initiate a connection. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-3332](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-3332)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 14.10
 : [linux-image-3.16.0-38-powerpc64-emb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.16.0-38.52](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.16.0-38.52) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.16.0-38-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.16.0-38.52](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.16.0-38.52) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.16.0-38-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.16.0-38.52](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.16.0-38.52) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.16.0-38-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.16.0-38.52](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.16.0-38.52) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.16.0-38-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.16.0-38.52](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.16.0-38.52) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.16.0-38-powerpc-e500mc](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.16.0-38.52](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.16.0-38.52) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.16.0-38-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.16.0-38.52](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.16.0-38.52) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
