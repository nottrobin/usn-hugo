### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.10

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

Chanam Park reported a Null pointer flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s Ceph client. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-1059](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1059))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s fanotify interface. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2148](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2148))

Jonathan Salwan discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel&#39;s cdrom driver. A local user can exploit this leak to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory if the CD-ROM drive is malfunctioning. ([CVE-2013-2164](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2164))

Kees Cook discovered a format string vulnerability in the Linux kernel&#39;s disk block layer. A local user with administrator privileges could exploit this flaw to gain kernel privileges. ([CVE-2013-2851](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2851)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.10
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-39-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-39.60](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-39.60) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-39-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-39.60](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-39.60) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-39-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-39.60](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-39.60) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-39-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-39.60](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-39.60) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-39-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-39.60](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-39.60) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
