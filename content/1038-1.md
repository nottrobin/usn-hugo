    Jakub Wilk and Raphael Hertzog discovered that dpkg-source did not correctly handle certain paths and symlinks when unpacking source-format version 3.0 packages. If a user or an automated system were tricked into unpacking a specially crafted source package, a remote attacker could modify files outside the target unpack directory, leading to a denial of service or potentially gaining access to the system.
