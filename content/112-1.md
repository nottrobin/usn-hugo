    An integer overflow was discovered in the exif_process_IFD_TAG() function in PHP4&#39;s EXIF module. EXIF tags with a specially crafted &quot;Image File Directory&quot; (IFD) tag caused a buffer overflow which could have been exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the PHP4 server.

### php4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

An integer overflow was discovered in the exif_process_IFD_TAG() function in PHP4&#39;s EXIF module. EXIF tags with a specially crafted &quot;Image File Directory&quot; (IFD) tag caused a buffer overflow which could have been exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the PHP4 server. (CAN-2005-1042)

The same module also contained a Denial of Service vulnerability. EXIF headers with a large IFD nesting level caused an unbound recursion which would eventually overflow the stack and cause the executed program to crash. (CAN-2005-1043)

In web applications that automatically process EXIF tags of uploaded images, both vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 4.10
 : libapache2-mod-php4 
 : php4-cgi 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).
