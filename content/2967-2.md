### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly enforce rlimits for file descriptors sent over UNIX domain sockets. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-4312](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4312))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Aiptek Tablet USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly sanity check the endpoints reported by the device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-7515](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7515))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Clie devices in the Linux kernel did not properly sanity check the endpoints reported by the device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-7566](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7566))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the usbvision driver in the Linux kernel did not properly sanity check the interfaces and endpoints reported by the device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-7833](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7833))

It was discovered that a race condition existed when handling heartbeat- timeout events in the SCTP implementation of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-8767](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8767))

Venkatesh Pottem discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel&#39;s CXGB3 driver. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-8812](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8812))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the ioctl handler for the TTY driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-0723](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-0723))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not keep accurate track of pipe buffer details when error conditions occurred, due to an incomplete fix for [CVE-2016-0774](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1805">CVE-2015-1805</a>. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-0774))

Zach Riggle discovered that the Linux kernel&#39;s list poison feature did not take into account the mmap_min_addr value. A local attacker could use this to bypass the kernel&#39;s poison-pointer protection mechanism while attempting to exploit an existing kernel vulnerability. ([CVE-2016-0821](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-0821))

Andy Lutomirski discovered a race condition in the Linux kernel&#39;s translation lookaside buffer (TLB) handling of flush events. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly leak sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-2069](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2069))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework did not verify that a FIFO was attached to a client before attempting to clear it. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2543](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2543))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that a race condition existed in the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework between timer setup and closing of the client, resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2544](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2544))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered a race condition in the timer handling implementation of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework, resulting in a use-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2545](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2545))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered race conditions in the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework&#39;s timer ioctls leading to a use-after-free. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2546](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2546))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework&#39;s handling of high resolution timers did not properly manage its data structures. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system hang or crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2548](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2547">CVE-2016-2547</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2548))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) framework&#39;s handling of high resolution timers could lead to a deadlock condition. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system hang). ([CVE-2016-2549](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2549))

Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the USB driver for Treo devices in the Linux kernel did not properly sanity check the endpoints reported by the device. An attacker with physical access could cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-2782](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2782))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not enforce limits on the amount of data allocated to buffer pipes. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion). ([CVE-2016-2847](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2847)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-1480-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [3.2.0-1480.106](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1480.106) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
