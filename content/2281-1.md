### linux-ec2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ec2 

### Details

 Sasha Levin reported a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s point-to-point protocol (PPP) when used with the Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP). A local user could exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2014-4943](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-4943))

An flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s audit subsystem when auditing certain syscalls. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive single-bit values from kernel memory or cause a denial of service (OOPS). ([CVE-2014-3917](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3917)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-2.6.32-368-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2) <span> [2.6.32-368.84](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2/2.6.32-368.84) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
