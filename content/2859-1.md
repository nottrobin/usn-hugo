    Andrei Vaida, Jesse Ruderman, Bob Clary, and Jesse Ruderman discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.

### Details

Andrei Vaida, Jesse Ruderman, Bob Clary, and Jesse Ruderman discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2015-7201](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7201))

Ronald Crane discovered a buffer overflow through code inspection. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2015-7205](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7205))

Abhishek Arya discovered an integer overflow when allocating large textures. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2015-7212](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7212))

Ronald Crane dicovered an integer overflow when processing MP4 format video in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2015-7213](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7213))

Tsubasa Iinuma discovered a way to bypass same-origin restrictions using data: and view-source: URLs. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information and read local files. ([CVE-2015-7214](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7214))
