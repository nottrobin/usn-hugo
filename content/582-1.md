### Details

It was discovered that Thunderbird did not properly set the size of a buffer when parsing an external-body MIME-type. If a user were to open a specially crafted email, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user. ([CVE-2008-0304](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0304))

Various flaws were discovered in Thunderbird and its JavaScript engine. By tricking a user into opening a malicious message, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2008-0413](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0412">CVE-2008-0412</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0413))

Various flaws were discovered in the JavaScript engine. By tricking a user into opening a malicious message, an attacker could escalate privileges within Thunderbird, perform cross-site scripting attacks and/or execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2008-0415](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0415))

Gerry Eisenhaur discovered that the chrome URI scheme did not properly guard against directory traversal. Under certain circumstances, an attacker may be able to load files or steal session data. Ubuntu is not vulnerable in the default installation. ([CVE-2008-0418](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0418))

Flaws were discovered in the BMP decoder. By tricking a user into opening a specially crafted BMP file, an attacker could obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2008-0420](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0420))
