Olli Pettay, Christoph Diehl, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Andrew McCreight, Joe Drew, Wayne Mery, Alon Zakai, Christian Holler, Gary Kwong, Luke Wagner, Terrence Cole, Timothy Nikkel, Bill McCloskey, and Nicolas Pierron discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash. ([CVE-2013-0784](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0783">CVE-2013-0783</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0784))

Atte Kettunen discovered that Firefox could perform an out-of-bounds read while rendering GIF format images. An attacker could exploit this to crash Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0772](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0772))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that Firefox did not properly handle some wrapped WebIDL objects. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0765](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0765))

Bobby Holley discovered vulnerabilities in Chrome Object Wrappers (COW) and System Only Wrappers (SOW). If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to bypass security protections to obtain sensitive information or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0773](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0773))

Frederik Braun that Firefox made the location of the active browser profile available to JavaScript workers. ([CVE-2013-0774](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0774))

A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in Firefox. An attacker could potentially exploit this to execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0775](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0775))

Michal Zalewski discovered that Firefox would not always show the correct address when cancelling a proxy authentication prompt. A remote attacker could exploit this to conduct URL spoofing and phishing attacks. ([CVE-2013-0776](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0776))

Abhishek Arya discovered several problems related to memory handling. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0782](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0777">CVE-2013-0777</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0778">CVE-2013-0778</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0779">CVE-2013-0779</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0780">CVE-2013-0780</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0781">CVE-2013-0781</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0782))
