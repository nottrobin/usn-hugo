### thunderbird vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 9.10
* Ubuntu 9.04
* Ubuntu 8.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Software description

* thunderbird 

### Details

Several flaws were discovered in the JavaScript engine of Thunderbird. If a user had JavaScript enabled and were tricked into viewing malicious web content, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-3075](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0689">CVE-2009-0689</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-2463">CVE-2009-2463</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3075))

Josh Soref discovered that the BinHex decoder used in Thunderbird contained a flaw. If a user were tricked into viewing malicious content, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-3072](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3072))

It was discovered that Thunderbird did not properly manage memory when using XUL tree elements. If a user were tricked into viewing malicious content, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-3077](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3077))

Jesse Ruderman and Sid Stamm discovered that Thunderbird did not properly display filenames containing right-to-left (RTL) override characters. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious file with a crafted filename, an attacker could exploit this to trick the user into opening a different file than the user expected. ([CVE-2009-3376](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3376))

Takehiro Takahashi discovered flaws in the NTLM implementation in Thunderbird. If an NTLM authenticated user opened content containing links to a malicious website, a remote attacker could send requests to other applications, authenticated as the user. ([CVE-2009-3983](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3983))

Ludovic Hirlimann discovered a flaw in the way Thunderbird indexed certain messages with attachments. A remote attacker could send specially crafted content and cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-0163](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-0163))
