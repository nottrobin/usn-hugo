releases: [ ubuntu-10.04-lts ]
date: 2011-12-06 12:00:00
description: |
    It was discovered that the 2.6.35 and earlier Linux kernel does not properly handle a high rate of creation and cleanup of network namespaces, which makes it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) in applications that require a separate namespace per connection, like vsftpd. This update adjusts vsftpd to only use network namespaces on kernels that are known to be not affected.
