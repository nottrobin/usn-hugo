    Chris Evans discovered that LittleCMS did not properly handle certain error conditions, resulting in a large memory leak. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing an image with malicious ICC tags, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service.

### lcms vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 7.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* lcms 

### Details

Chris Evans discovered that LittleCMS did not properly handle certain error conditions, resulting in a large memory leak. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing an image with malicious ICC tags, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-0581](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0581))

Chris Evans discovered that LittleCMS contained multiple integer overflows. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing an image with malicious ICC tags, a remote attacker could crash applications linked against liblcms1, leading to a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2009-0723](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0723))

Chris Evans discovered that LittleCMS did not properly perform bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing an image with malicious ICC tags, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2009-0733](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0733))
