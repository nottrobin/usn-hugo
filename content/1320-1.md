    Steve Manzuik discovered that FFmpeg incorrectly handled certain malformed Matroska files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted Matroska file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.
