### linux-ec2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ec2 

### Details

An information leak was discovered in the handling of ICMPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) messages in the Linux kernel&#39;s IPv6 network stack. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (excessive retries and address-generation outage), and consequently obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-0343](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0343))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) via a specially crafted device that provides an invalid Report ID. ([CVE-2013-2888](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2888))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of the Linux kerenl when CONFIG_HID_PANTHERLORD is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (heap out-of-bounds write) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2892](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2892)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-2.6.32-357-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2) <span> [2.6.32-357.70](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2/2.6.32-357.70) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
