### openssl vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04

### Details

Dr. Henson of the OpenSSL core team and Open Network Security discovered a mishandled error condition in the ASN.1 parser. By sending specially crafted packet data, a remote attacker could exploit this to trigger an infinite loop, which would render the service unusable and consume all available system memory. ([CVE-2006-2937](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-2937))

Certain types of public key could take disproportionate amounts of time to process. The library now limits the maximum key exponent size to avoid Denial of Service attacks. ([CVE-2006-2940](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-2940))

Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry of the Google Security Team discovered a buffer overflow in the SSL_get_shared_ciphers() function. By sending specially crafted packets to applications that use this function (like Exim, MySQL, or the openssl command line tool), a remote attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the server&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2006-3738](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3738))

Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry of the Google Security Team reported that the get_server_hello() function did not sufficiently check the client&#39;s session certificate. This could be exploited to crash clients by remote attackers sending specially crafted SSL responses. ([CVE-2006-4343](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4343))

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : libssl0.9.8 <span>0.9.8a-7ubuntu0.2</span>

Ubuntu 5.10
 : libssl0.9.7 <span>0.9.7g-1ubuntu1.3</span>

Ubuntu 5.04
 : libssl0.9.7 <span>0.9.7e-3ubuntu0.4</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to effect the necessary changes.
