    Kevin Finisterre discovered that the TIFF library did not correctly handle certain image structures.  If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted TIFF image, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with user privileges, or crash the application, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2010-1411](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1411))

Dan Rosenberg and Sauli Pahlman discovered multiple flaws in the TIFF library. If a user or automated system were into opening a specially crafted TIFF image, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with user privileges, or crash the application, leading to a denial of service. (Only Ubuntu 10.04 LTS was affected.)
