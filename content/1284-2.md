We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 David Black discovered that Update Manager incorrectly extracted the downloaded upgrade tarball before verifying its GPG signature. If a remote attacker were able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could potentially be used to replace arbitrary files. ([CVE-2011-3154](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3152">CVE-2011-3152</a>) David Black discovered that Update Manager created a temporary directory in an insecure fashion. A local attacker could possibly use this flaw to read the XAUTHORITY file of the user performing the upgrade. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3154)) This update also adds a hotfix to Update Notifier to handle cases where the upgrade is being performed from CD media.
