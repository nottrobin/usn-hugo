### linux-raspi2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-raspi2 

### Details

A missing permission check when settings ACLs was discovered in nfsd. A local user could exploit this flaw to gain access to any file by setting an ACL. ([CVE-2016-1237](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1237))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-5244](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5244))

James Patrick-Evans discovered that the airspy USB device driver in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions. An attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (memory consumption). ([CVE-2016-5400](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5400))

Yue Cao et al discovered a flaw in the TCP implementation&#39;s handling of challenge acks in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (reset connection) or inject content into an TCP stream. ([CVE-2016-5696](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5696))

Pengfei Wang discovered a race condition in the MIC VOP driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-5728](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5728))

Cyril Bur discovered that on PowerPC platforms, the Linux kernel mishandled transactional memory state on exec(). A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5828](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5828))

It was discovered that a heap based buffer overflow existed in the USB HID driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5829](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5829))

It was discovered that the OverlayFS implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly verify dentry state before proceeding with unlink and rename operations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-6197](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-6197)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-4.4.0-1021-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-raspi2) <span> [4.4.0-1021.27](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-raspi2/4.4.0-1021.27) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
