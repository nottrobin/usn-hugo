If debdiff processed a crafted file, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

Paul Wise discovered that debdiff did not properly sanitize its input when processing .dsc and .changes files. If debdiff processed a crafted file, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-0210](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0210))

Raphael Geissert discovered that debdiff did not properly sanitize its input when processing source packages. If debdiff processed an original source tarball, with crafted filenames in the top-level directory, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-0211](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0211))

Raphael Geissert discovered that debdiff did not properly sanitize its input when processing filename parameters. If debdiff processed a crafted filename parameter, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-0212](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0212))
