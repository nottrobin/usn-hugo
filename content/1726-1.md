### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.10

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

It was discovered that hypervkvpd, which is distributed in the Linux kernel, was not correctly validating the origin on Netlink messages. An untrusted local user can cause a denial of service of Linux guests in Hyper-V virtualization environments. ([CVE-2012-2669](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2669))

Dmitry Monakhov reported a race condition flaw the Linux ext4 filesystem that can expose stale data. An unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause an information leak. ([CVE-2012-4508](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4508))

Florian Weimer discovered that hypervkvpd, which is distributed in the Linux kernel, was not correctly validating source addresses of netlink packets. An untrusted local user can cause a denial of service by causing hypervkvpd to exit. ([CVE-2012-5532](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5532)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 11.10
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-1221-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [3.0.0-1221.34](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/3.0.0-1221.34) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
