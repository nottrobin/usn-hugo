### postgresql-8.1 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Details

Michael Fuhr discovered an incorrect type check when handling unknown literals. By attempting to coerce such a literal to the ANYARRAY type, a local authenticated attacker could cause a server crash.

Josh Drake and Alvaro Herrera reported a crash when using aggregate functions in UPDATE statements. A local authenticated attacker could exploit this to crash the server backend. This update disables this construct, since it is not very well defined and forbidden by the SQL standard.

Sergey Koposov discovered a flaw in the duration logging. This could cause a server crash under certain circumstances.

Please note that these flaws can usually not be exploited through web and other applications that use a database and are exposed to untrusted input, so these flaws do not pose a threat in usual setups.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : postgresql-8.1 <span>8.1.4-0ubuntu1.1</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the necessary changes.
