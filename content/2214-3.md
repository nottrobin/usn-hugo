### libxml2 regression

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 13.10
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

USN-2214-1 introduced a regression in libxml2. 

### Software description

* libxml2 

### Details

USN-2214-1 fixed vulnerabilities in libxml2. The upstream fix introduced a number of regressions. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Daniel Berrange discovered that libxml2 would incorrectly perform entity substitution even when requested not to. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted document, an attacker could possibly cause resource consumption, resulting in a denial of service.
