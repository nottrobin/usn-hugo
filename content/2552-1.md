* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird. 

### Software description

* thunderbird 

### Details

Olli Pettay and Boris Zbarsky discovered an issue during anchor navigations in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin policy restrictions. ([CVE-2015-0801](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0801))

Christoph Kerschbaumer discovered that CORS requests from navigator.sendBeacon() followed 30x redirections after preflight. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site request forgery (XSRF) attacks. ([CVE-2015-0807](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0807))

Aki Helin discovered a use-after-free when playing MP3 audio files using the Fluendo MP3 GStreamer plugin in certain circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2015-0813](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0813))

Christian Holler, Steve Fink, and Byron Campen discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2015-0815](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0815))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that documents loaded via resource: URLs (such as PDF.js) could load privileged chrome pages. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this in combination with another flaw, in order to execute arbitrary script in a privileged context. ([CVE-2015-0816](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0816))
