* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 9.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Summary

Multiple vulnerabilities in Firefox and Xulrunner 

### Software description

* firefox 

* firefox-3.0 

* firefox-3.5 

* xulrunner-1.9.2 

### Details

It was discovered that there was a vulnerability in the memory handling of certain types of content. An attacker could exploit this to possibly run arbitrary code as the user running Firefox. ([CVE-2011-0081](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0081))

It was discovered that Firefox incorrectly handled certain JavaScript requests. An attacker could exploit this to possibly run arbitrary code as the user running Firefox. ([CVE-2011-0069](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0069))

Ian Beer discovered a vulnerability in the memory handling of a certain types of documents. An attacker could exploit this to possibly run arbitrary code as the user running Firefox. ([CVE-2011-0070](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0070))

Bob Clary, Henri Sivonen, Marco Bonardo, Mats Palmgren and Jesse Ruderman discovered several memory vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these to possibly run arbitrary code as the user running Firefox. ([CVE-2011-0080](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0080))

Aki Helin discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the HTML rendering code. An attacker could exploit these to possibly run arbitrary code as the user running Firefox.

Martin Barbella discovered a memory vulnerability in the handling of certain DOM elements. An attacker could exploit this to possibly run arbitrary code as the user running Firefox. ([CVE-2011-0072](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0072))

It was discovered that there were use-after-free vulnerabilities in Firefox&#39;s mChannel and mObserverList objects. An attacker could exploit these to possibly run arbitrary code as the user running Firefox. ([CVE-2011-0066](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0065">CVE-2011-0065</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0066))

It was discovered that there was a vulnerability in the handling of the nsTreeSelection element. An attacker serving malicious content could exploit this to possibly run arbitrary code as the user running Firefox. ([CVE-2011-0073](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0073))

Paul Stone discovered a vulnerability in the handling of Java applets. An attacker could use this to mimic interaction with form autocomplete controls and steal entries from the form history. ([CVE-2011-0067](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0067))

Soroush Dalili discovered a vulnerability in the resource: protocol. This could potentially allow an attacker to load arbitrary files that were accessible to the user running Firefox. ([CVE-2011-0071](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0071))

Chris Evans discovered a vulnerability in Firefox&#39;s XSLT generate-id() function. An attacker could possibly use this vulnerability to make other attacks more reliable. ([CVE-2011-1202](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1202))
