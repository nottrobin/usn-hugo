    It was discovered that xine-lib did not correctly handle certain malformed Ogg and Windows Media files. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted Ogg or Windows Media file, an attacker could cause xine-lib to crash, creating a denial of service. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 7.10, and 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2008-3231](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3231))

([CVE-2008-5239](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5239))

It was discovered that the Matroska and Real demuxers in xine-lib did not correctly handle memory allocation failures. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted Matroska or Real file, an attacker could crash xine-lib or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-5240](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5240))

It was discovered that the QT demuxer in xine-lib did not correctly handle an invalid metadata atom size in a compressed MOV file, resulting in an integer underflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted MOV file, an attacker could an attacker could cause xine-lib to crash, creating a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-5241](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5241))

It was discovered that the ffmpeg video decoder in xine-lib did not correctly handle media with certain image heights, resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted video file, an attacker could crash xine-lib or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 7.10, 8.04 LTS, and 8.10.

It was discovered that the ffmpeg audio decoder in xine-lib did not correctly handle malformed media, resulting in a integer overflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted media file, an attacker could crash xine-lib or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 8.10. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 8.10
