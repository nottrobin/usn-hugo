It was discovered that the PHP xmlrpc extension did not correctly check heap memory allocation sizes. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted request to a PHP application using xmlrpc and execute arbitrary code as the Apache user. ([CVE-2007-1864](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-1864))

Stefan Esser discovered a flaw in the random number initialization of the PHP SOAP extension. This could lead to remote attackers being able to predict certain elements of the authentication mechanism. ([CVE-2007-2728](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2728))
