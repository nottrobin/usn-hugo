title: "USN-58-1: MIT Kerberos server vulnerability"
series: [ ubuntu-04.10]
date: 2005-01-10 12:00:00
description: |
    Michael Tautschnig discovered a possible buffer overflow in the add_to_history() function in the MIT Kerberos 5 implementation. Performing a password change did not properly track the password policy&#39;s history count and the maximum number of keys. This could cause an array overflow and may have allowed authenticated users (not necessarily one with administrative privileges) to execute arbitrary code on the KDC host, compromising an entire Kerberos realm.
