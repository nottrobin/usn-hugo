    Multiple memory safety issues were discovered in Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

### firefox vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 13.04
* Ubuntu 12.10
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened a malicious website.

### Software description

* firefox 

### Details

Multiple memory safety issues were discovered in Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-1683](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1682">CVE-2013-1682</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1683))

Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free bugs. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-1686](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1684">CVE-2013-1684</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1685">CVE-2013-1685</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1686))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that user defined code within the XBL scope of an element could be made to bypass System Only Wrappers (SOW). An attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-1687](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1687))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the profiler user interface incorrectly handled data from the profiler. If the user examined profiler output on a specially crafted page, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-1688](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1688))

A crash was discovered when reloading a page that contained content using the onreadystatechange event. An attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox ([CVE-2013-1690](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1690))

Johnathan Kuskos discovered that Firefox sent data in the body of XMLHttpRequest HEAD requests. An attacker could exploit this to conduct Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. ([CVE-2013-1692](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1692))

Paul Stone discovered a timing flaw in the processing of SVG images with filters. An attacker could exploit this to view sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-1693](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1693))

Boris Zbarsky discovered a flaw in PreserveWrapper. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-1694](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1694))

Bob Owen discovered that a sandboxed iframe could use a frame element to bypass its own restrictions. ([CVE-2013-1695](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1695))

Frédéric Buclin discovered that the X-Frame-Options header is ignored in multi-part responses. An attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct clickjacking attacks. ([CVE-2013-1696](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1696))

It was discovered that XrayWrappers could be bypassed to call content-defined methods in certain circumstances. An attacker could exploit this to cause undefined behaviour. ([CVE-2013-1697](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1697))

Matt Wobensmith discovered that the getUserMedia permission dialog displayed the wrong domain in certain circumstances. An attacker could potentially exploit this to trick the user in to giving a malicious site access to their microphone or camera. ([CVE-2013-1698](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1698))

It was discovered that the measures for preventing homograph attacks using Internationalized Domain Names (IDN) were not sufficient for certain Top Level Domains (TLD). An attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct URL spoofing and phishing attacks. ([CVE-2013-1699](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1699)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:
