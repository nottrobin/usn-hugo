    Jesse Ruderman and Bob Clary discovered memory safety issues affecting the Gecko Browser engine. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Xulrunner.

### xulrunner-1.9.2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.10
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Xulrunner. 

### Software description

* xulrunner-1.9.2 

### Details

Jesse Ruderman and Bob Clary discovered memory safety issues affecting the Gecko Browser engine. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Xulrunner. ([CVE-2012-0442](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0442))

It was discovered that the Gecko Browser engine did not properly handle node removal in the DOM. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Xulrunner. ([CVE-2011-3659](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3659))

It was discovered that memory corruption could occur during the decoding of Ogg Vorbis files. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted file, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Xulrunner. ([CVE-2012-0444](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0444))

Nicolas Gregoire and Aki Helin discovered that when processing a malformed embedded XSLT stylesheet, Xulrunner can crash due to memory corruption. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Xulrunner. ([CVE-2012-0449](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0449))

Gregory Fleischer discovered that requests using IPv6 hostname syntax through certain proxies might generate errors. An attacker might be able to use this to read sensitive data from the error messages. ([CVE-2011-3670](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3670))
