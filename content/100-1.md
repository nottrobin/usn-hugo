    Javier Fern�ez-Sanguino Pe�oticed that cdrecord created temporary files in an insecure manner if DEBUG was enabled in /etc/cdrecord/rscsi. If the default value was used (which stored the debug output file in /tmp), this could allow a symbolic link attack to create or overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the user invoking cdrecord.

### cdrtools vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Javier Fern�ez-Sanguino Pe�oticed that cdrecord created temporary files in an insecure manner if DEBUG was enabled in /etc/cdrecord/rscsi. If the default value was used (which stored the debug output file in /tmp), this could allow a symbolic link attack to create or overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the user invoking cdrecord.

Please note that DEBUG is not enabled by default in Ubuntu, so if you did not explicitly enable it, this does not affect you.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 4.10
 : cdrecord 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

None
