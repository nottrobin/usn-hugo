    Kees Cook discovered that the PAM pam_env module incorrectly handled certain malformed environment files. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service, or possibly gain privileges. The default compiler options for affected releases should reduce the vulnerability to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-3148](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3148))

### Details

Kees Cook discovered that the PAM pam_env module incorrectly handled certain malformed environment files. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service, or possibly gain privileges. The default compiler options for affected releases should reduce the vulnerability to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-3148](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3148))

Kees Cook discovered that the PAM pam_env module incorrectly handled variable expansion. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-3149](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3149))

Stephane Chazelas discovered that the PAM pam_motd module incorrectly cleaned the environment during execution of the motd scripts. In certain environments, a local attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code as root, and gain privileges.
