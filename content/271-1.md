### mozilla-firefox, firefox vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04
* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Web pages with extremely long titles caused subsequent launches of Firefox browser to hang for up to a few minutes, or caused Firefox to crash on computers with insufficient memory. ([CVE-2005-4134](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2005-4134))

Igor Bukanov discovered that the JavaScript engine did not properly declare some temporary variables. Under some rare circumstances, a malicious website could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. ([CVE-2006-1742](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-0292">CVE-2006-0292</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-1742))

The function XULDocument.persist() did not sufficiently validate the names of attributes. An attacker could exploit this to inject arbitrary XML code into the file &#39;localstore.rdf&#39;, which is read and evaluated at startup. This could include JavaScript commands that would be run with the user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2006-0296](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-0296))

Due to a flaw in the HTML tag parser a specific sequence of HTML tags caused memory corruption. A malicious web site could exploit this to crash the browser or even execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2006-0749](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-0749))

Georgi Guninski discovered that embedded XBL scripts of web sites could escalate their (normally reduced) privileges to get full privileges of the user if that page is viewed with &quot;Print Preview&quot;. ([CVE-2006-1727](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-1727))

The crypto.generateCRMFRequest() function had a flaw which could be exploited to run arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2006-1728](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-1728))

Claus Jï¿½sen and Jesse Ruderman discovered that a text input box could be pre-filled with a filename and then turned into a file-upload control with the contents intact. A malicious web site could exploit this to read any local file the user has read privileges for. ([CVE-2006-1729](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-1729))

An integer overflow was detected in the handling of the CSS property &quot;letter-spacing&quot;. A malicious web site could exploit this to run arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2006-1730](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-1730))

The methods valueOf.call() and .valueOf.apply() returned an object whose privileges were not properly confined to those of the caller, which made them vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks. A malicious web site could exploit this to modify the contents or steal confidential data (such as passwords) from other opened web pages. ([CVE-2006-1741](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-1731">CVE-2006-1731</a>) The window.controllers array variable (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-1732">CVE-2006-1732</a>) and event handlers (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-1741)) were vulnerable to a similar attack. 

The privileged built-in XBL bindings were not fully protected from web content and could be accessed by calling valueOf.call() and valueOf.apply() on a method of that binding. A malicious web site could exploit this to run arbitrary JavaScript code with the user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2006-1733](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-1733))

It was possible to use the Object.watch() method to access an internal function object (the &quot;clone parent&quot;). A malicious web site could exploit this to execute arbitrary JavaScript code with the user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2006-1734](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-1734))

By calling the XBL.method.eval() method in a special way it was possible to create JavaScript functions that would get compiled with the wrong privileges. A malicious web site could exploit this to execute arbitrary JavaScript code with the user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2006-1735](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-1735))

Michael Krax discovered that by layering a transparent image link to an executable on top of a visible (and presumably desirable) image a malicious site could fool the user to right-click and choose &quot;Save image as...&quot; from the context menu, which would download the executable instead of the image. ([CVE-2006-1736](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-1736))

Several crashes have been fixed which could be triggered by web sites and involve memory corruption. These could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2006-1790](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-1737">CVE-2006-1737</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-1738">CVE-2006-1738</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-1739">CVE-2006-1739</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-1790))

If the user has turned on the &quot;Entering secure site&quot; modal warning dialog, it was possible to spoof the browser&#39;s secure-site indicators (the lock icon and the gold URL field background) by first loading the target secure site in a pop-up window, then changing its location to a different site, which retained the displayed secure-browsing indicators from the original site. ([CVE-2006-1740](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-1740))
