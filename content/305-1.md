### openldap2, openldap2.2 vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04

### Details

When processing overly long host names in OpenLDAP&#39;s slurpd replication server, a buffer overflow caused slurpd to crash.

If an attacker manages to inject a specially crafted host name into slurpd, this might also be exploited to execute arbitrary code with slurpd&#39;s privileges; however, since slurpd is usually set up to replicate only trusted machines, this should not be exploitable in normal cases.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : slapd <span>2.2.26-5ubuntu2.1</span>

Ubuntu 5.10
 : slapd <span>2.2.26-3ubuntu0.1</span>

Ubuntu 5.04
 : slapd <span>2.1.30-3ubuntu3.2</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the necessary changes.
