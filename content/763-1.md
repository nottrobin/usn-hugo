    It was discovered that the QT demuxer in xine-lib did not correctly handle a large count value in an STTS atom, resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted MOV file, an attacker could execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

### xine-lib vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* xine-lib 

### Details

It was discovered that the QT demuxer in xine-lib did not correctly handle a large count value in an STTS atom, resulting in a heap-based buffer overflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted MOV file, an attacker could execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-1274](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1274))

USN-746-1 provided updated xine-lib packages to fix multiple security vulnerabilities. The security patch to fix [CVE-2009-0698](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0698) was incomplete. This update corrects the problem.

Original advisory details: It was discovered that the 4xm demuxer in xine-lib did not correctly handle a large current_track value in a 4xm file, resulting in an integer overflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted 4xm movie file, an attacker could crash xine-lib or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-0698](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0698)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 8.10
 : [libxine1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xine-lib) <span> [1.1.15-0ubuntu3.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xine-lib/1.1.15-0ubuntu3.3) </span> 

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
 : [libxine1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xine-lib) <span> [1.1.11.1-1ubuntu3.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xine-lib/1.1.11.1-1ubuntu3.4) </span> 

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : [libxine-main1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xine-lib) <span> [1.1.1+ubuntu2-7.12](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xine-lib/1.1.1+ubuntu2-7.12) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart applications linked against xine-lib, such as Totem-xine and Amarok, to effect the necessary changes.
