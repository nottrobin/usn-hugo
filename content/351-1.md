### firefox vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Details

Various flaws have been reported that allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with user privileges by tricking the user into opening a malicious web page containing JavaScript. ([CVE-2006-4571](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4253">CVE-2006-4253</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4565">CVE-2006-4565</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4566">CVE-2006-4566</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4568">CVE-2006-4568</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4569">CVE-2006-4569</a> <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4571))

The NSS library did not sufficiently check the padding of PKCS #1 v1.5 signatures if the exponent of the public key is 3 (which is widely used for CAs). This could be exploited to forge valid signatures without the need of the secret key. ([CVE-2006-4340](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4340))

Jon Oberheide reported a way how a remote attacker could trick users into downloading arbitrary extensions with circumventing the normal SSL certificate check. The attacker would have to be in a position to spoof the victim&#39;s DNS, causing them to connect to sites of the attacker&#39;s choosing rather than the sites intended by the victim. If they gained that control and the victim accepted the attacker&#39;s cert for the Mozilla update site, then the next update check could be hijacked and redirected to the attacker&#39;s site without detection. ([CVE-2006-4567](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4567))

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : firefox <span>1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.7-ubuntu0.6.06</span>
 : libnss3 <span>1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.7-ubuntu0.6.06</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Firefox to effect the necessary changes.

Please note that Firefox 1.0.8 in Ubuntu 5.10 and Ubuntu 5.04 are also affected by these problems. Updates for these Ubuntu releases will be delayed due to upstream dropping support for this Firefox version. We strongly advise that you disable JavaScript to disable the attack vectors for most vulnerabilities if you use one of these Ubuntu versions. An update is currently in progress.
