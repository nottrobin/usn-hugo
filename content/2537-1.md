### openssl vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.10
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in OpenSSL. 

### Software description

* openssl 

### Details

It was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled malformed EC private key files. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-0209](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0209))

Stephen Henson discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled comparing ASN.1 boolean types. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-0286](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0286))

Emilia Käsper discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled ASN.1 structure reuse. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-0287](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0287))

Brian Carpenter discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled invalid certificate keys. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-0288](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0288))

Michal Zalewski discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled missing outer ContentInfo when parsing PKCS#7 structures. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-0289](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0289))

Robert Dugal and David Ramos discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled decoding Base64 encoded data. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-0292](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0292))

Sean Burford and Emilia Käsper discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled specially crafted SSLv2 CLIENT-MASTER-KEY messages. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-0293](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0293))
