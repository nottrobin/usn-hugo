    Evgeny Legerov discovered that gnupg did not sufficiently check the validity of the comment and a control field. Specially crafted GPG data could cause a buffer overflow. This could be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges if an attacker can trick an user into processing a malicious encrypted/signed document with gnupg.
