### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly initialize IPC object state in certain situations. A local attacker could use this to escalate their privileges, expose confidential information, or cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-7613](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7613))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not check if a new IPv6 MTU set by a user space application was valid. A remote attacker could forge a route advertisement with an invalid MTU that a user space daemon like NetworkManager would honor and apply to the kernel, causing a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-0272](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0272))

It was discovered that in certain situations, a directory could be renamed outside of a bind mounted location. An attacker could use this to escape bind mount containment and gain access to sensitive information. ([CVE-2015-2925](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2925))

Moein Ghasemzadeh discovered that the USB WhiteHEAT serial driver contained hardcoded attributes about the USB devices. An attacker could construct a fake WhiteHEAT USB device that, when inserted, causes a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-5257](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-5257)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-93-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-93.133](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-93.133) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-93-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-93.133](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-93.133) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-93-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-93.133](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-93.133) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-93-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-93.133](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-93.133) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-93-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-93.133](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-93.133) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-93-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-93.133](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-93.133) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-93-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-93.133](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-93.133) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
