description: |
    An error was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s network TUN/TAP device implementation. A local user with access to the TUN/TAP interface (which is not available to unprivileged users until granted by a root user) could exploit this flaw to crash the system or potential gain administrative privileges.

### linux-ec2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ec2 

### Details

An error was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s network TUN/TAP device implementation. A local user with access to the TUN/TAP interface (which is not available to unprivileged users until granted by a root user) could exploit this flaw to crash the system or potential gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2012-2136](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2136))

An error was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s memory subsystem (hugetlb). An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash the system). ([CVE-2012-2390](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2390)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-2.6.32-347-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2) <span> [2.6.32-347.52](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2/2.6.32-347.52) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
