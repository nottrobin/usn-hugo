    It was discovered that the HPLIP Polkit daemon incorrectly handled temporary files. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to overwrite arbitrary files. In the default installation of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and higher, this should be prevented by the Yama link restrictions. ([CVE-2013-6402](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-6402))

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in HPLIP. 

### Software description

* hplip 

### Details

It was discovered that the HPLIP Polkit daemon incorrectly handled temporary files. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to overwrite arbitrary files. In the default installation of Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and higher, this should be prevented by the Yama link restrictions. ([CVE-2013-6402](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-6402))

It was discovered that HPLIP contained an upgrade tool that would download code in an unsafe fashion. If a remote attacker were able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2013-6427](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-6427))
