### linux-lts-trusty vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-trusty 

### Details

 A flaw was discovered in the user space memory copying for the pipe iovecs in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially escalate their privileges. ([CVE-2015-1805](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1805))

A flaw was discovered in the kvm (kernel virtual machine) subsystem&#39;s kvm_apic_has_events function. A unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-4692](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-4692))

Daniel Borkmann reported a kernel crash in the Linux kernel&#39;s BPF filter JIT optimization. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-4700](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-4700))

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service using a flood of UDP packets with invalid checksums. ([CVE-2015-5364](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-5364))

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker can cause a denial of service against applications that use epoll by injecting a single packet with an invalid checksum. ([CVE-2015-5366](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-5366))

A double free flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s path lookup. A local user could cause a denial of service (Oops). ([CVE-2015-5706](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-5706)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-58-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty) <span> [3.13.0-58.97~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-58.97~precise1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-58-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty) <span> [3.13.0-58.97~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-58.97~precise1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
