Original advisory details:

 Jeff Gilbert, Henrik Skupin, Ben Turner, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, Gary Kwong, Jan Varga and Jesse Ruderman discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If the user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-1717](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1701">CVE-2013-1701</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1702">CVE-2013-1702</a>) A use-after-free bug was discovered when the DOM is modified during a SetBody mutation event. If the user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1704">CVE-2013-1704</a>) A use-after-free bug was discovered when generating a CRMF request with certain parameters. If the user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1705">CVE-2013-1705</a>) Aki Helin discovered a crash when decoding a WAV file in some circumstances. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1708">CVE-2013-1708</a>) It was discovered that a document&#39;s URI could be set to the URI of a different document. An attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1709">CVE-2013-1709</a>) A flaw was discovered when generating a CRMF request in certain circumstances. An attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1710">CVE-2013-1710</a>) Bobby Holley discovered that XBL scopes could be used to circumvent XrayWrappers in certain circumstances. An attacked could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or cause undefined behaviour. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1711">CVE-2013-1711</a>) Cody Crews discovered that some Javascript components performed security checks against the wrong URI, potentially bypassing same-origin policy restrictions. An attacker could exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or install addons from a malicious site. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1713">CVE-2013-1713</a>) Federico Lanusse discovered that web workers could bypass cross-origin checks when using XMLHttpRequest. An attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1714">CVE-2013-1714</a>) Georgi Guninski and John Schoenick discovered that Java applets could access local files under certain circumstances. An attacker could potentially exploit this to steal confidential data. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1717))
