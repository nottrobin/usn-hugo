### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

A stack overflow was discovered in the the microcode loader for the intel x86 platform. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel crash) or to potentially execute code with kernel privileges. ([CVE-2015-2666](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2666))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel&#39;s IPv6 networking stack has a flaw that allows using route advertisement (RA) messages to set the &#39;hop_limit&#39; to values that are too low. An unprivileged attacker on a local network could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (IPv6 messages dropped). ([CVE-2015-2922](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2922)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-51-powerpc64-emb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.13.0-51.84](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.13.0-51.84) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-51-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.13.0-51.84](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.13.0-51.84) </span>

 : [linux-image-3.13.0-51-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.13.0-51.84](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.13.0-51.84) </span>

 : [linux-image-3.13.0-51-powerpc-e500mc](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.13.0-51.84](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.13.0-51.84) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-51-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.13.0-51.84](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.13.0-51.84) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
