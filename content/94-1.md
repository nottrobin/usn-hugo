    Paul Szabo discovered another vulnerability in the rmtree() function in File::Path.pm. While a process running as root (or another user) was busy deleting a directory tree, a different user could exploit a race condition to create setuid binaries in this directory tree, provided that he already had write permissions in any subdirectory of that tree.
