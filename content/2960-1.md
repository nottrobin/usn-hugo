### oxide-qt vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 15.10
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Oxide. 

### Software description

* oxide-qt 

### Details

An out of bounds write was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-1660](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1660))

It was discovered that Blink assumes that a frame which passes same-origin checks is local in some cases. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-1661](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1661))

A use-after-free was discovered in the V8 bindings in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-1663](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1663))

It was discovered that the JSGenericLowering class in V8 mishandles comparison operators. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-1665](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1665))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-1666](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1666))

It was discovered that the TreeScope::adoptIfNeeded function in Blink does not prevent script execution during node-adoption operations. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2016-1667](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1667))

It was discovered that the forEachForBinding in the V8 bindings in Blink uses an improper creation context. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2016-1668](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1668))

A buffer overflow was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-1669](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1669))

A race condition was discovered in ResourceDispatcherHostImpl in Chromium. An attacker could potentially exploit this to make arbitrary HTTP requests. ([CVE-2016-1670](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1670))
