    Gary Kwong, Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Hannes Verschore, Jan de Mooij, Ryan VanderMeulen, Jeff Walden and Kyle Huey discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.
