Original advisory details:

 Jesse Ruderman, Igor Bukanov, Bill McCloskey, Christian Holler, Andrew McCreight, Olli Pettay, Boris Zbarsky, and Brian Bondy discovered memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1947](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1937">CVE-2012-1937</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1938">CVE-2012-1938</a>) It was discovered that Mozilla&#39;s WebGL implementation exposed a bug in certain NVIDIA graphics drivers. The impact of this issue has not been disclosed at this time. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3101">CVE-2011-3101</a>) Adam Barth discovered that certain inline event handlers were not being blocked properly by the Content Security Policy&#39;s (CSP) inline-script blocking feature. Web applications relying on this feature of CSP to protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) were not fully protected. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1944">CVE-2012-1944</a>) Paul Stone discovered that a viewed HTML page hosted on a Windows or Samba share could load Windows shortcut files (.lnk) in the same share. These shortcut files could then link to arbitrary locations on the local file system of the individual loading the HTML page. An attacker could potentially use this vulnerability to show the contents of these linked files or directories in an iframe, resulting in information disclosure. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1945">CVE-2012-1945</a>) Arthur Gerkis discovered a use-after-free vulnerability while replacing/inserting a node in a document. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1946">CVE-2012-1946</a>) Kaspar Brand discovered a vulnerability in how the Network Security Services (NSS) ASN.1 decoder handles zero length items. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0441">CVE-2012-0441</a>) Abhishek Arya discovered two buffer overflow and one use-after-free vulnerabilities. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1940">CVE-2012-1940</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1941">CVE-2012-1941</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1947))
