    Paul Szabo discovered that the DECRQSS escape sequences were not handled correctly by xterm.  Additionally, window title operations were also not safely handled.  If a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted series of characters while in xterm, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary commands with user privileges.
