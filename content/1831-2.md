### nova regression

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.10

### Summary

USN-1831-1 introduced a regression in OpenStack Nova. 

### Software description

* nova 

### Details

USN-1831-1 fixed a vulnerability in OpenStack Nova. The upstream fix introduced a regression where instances using uncached QCOW2 images would fail to start. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Loganathan Parthipan discovered that Nova did not verify the size of QCOW2 instance storage. An authenticated attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service by creating an image with a large virtual size with little data, then filling the virtual disk. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.10
 : [python-nova](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nova) <span> [2012.2.3-0ubuntu2.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nova/2012.2.3-0ubuntu2.2) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
