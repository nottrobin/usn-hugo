### libnet-dns-perl vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Details

Peter Johannes Holzer discovered that the Net::DNS Perl module had predictable sequence numbers. This could allow remote attackers to carry out DNS spoofing, leading to possible man-in-the-middle attacks. ([CVE-2007-3377](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-3377))

Steffen Ullrich discovered that the Net::DNS Perl module did not correctly detect recursive compressed responses. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted packet, causing applications using Net::DNS to crash or monopolize CPU resources, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-3409](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-3409))

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 6.10
 : libnet-dns-perl <span>0.57-1ubuntu1</span>
