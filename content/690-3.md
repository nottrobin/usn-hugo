### firefox vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* firefox 

### Details

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine. These problems could allow an attacker to crash the browser and possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-5500](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5500))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that the same-origin check in Firefox could be bypassed by utilizing XBL-bindings. An attacker could exploit this to read data from other domains. ([CVE-2008-5503](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5503))

Marius Schilder discovered that Firefox did not properly handle redirects to an outside domain when an XMLHttpRequest was made to a same-origin resource. It&#39;s possible that sensitive information could be revealed in the XMLHttpRequest response. ([CVE-2008-5506](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5506))

Chris Evans discovered that Firefox did not properly protect a user&#39;s data when accessing a same-domain Javascript URL that is redirected to an unparsable Javascript off-site resource. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker may be able to steal a limited amount of private data. ([CVE-2008-5507](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5507))

Several flaws were discovered in the Javascript engine. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary Javascript code within the context of another website or with chrome privileges. ([CVE-2008-5512](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5511">CVE-2008-5511</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5512)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox) <span> [1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.15~prepatch080614i-0ubuntu1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox/1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.15~prepatch080614i-0ubuntu1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Firefox to effect the necessary changes.
