### libxml2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 7.10
* Ubuntu 7.04
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* libxml2 

### Details

It was discovered that libxml2 did not correctly handle long entity names. If a user were tricked into processing a specially crafted XML document, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with user privileges or cause the application linked against libxml2 to crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-3529](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3529))

USN-640-1 fixed vulnerabilities in libxml2. When processing extremely large XML documents with valid entities, it was possible to incorrectly trigger the newly added vulnerability protections. This update fixes the problem. ([CVE-2008-3281](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3281))
