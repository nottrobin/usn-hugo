### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 13.04

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

Vince Weaver discovered a flaw in the perf subsystem of the Linux kernel on ARM platforms. A local user could exploit this flaw to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4254](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4254))

A failure to validate block numbers was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s implementation of the XFS filesystem. A local user can cause a denial of service (system crash) if they can mount, or cause to be mounted a corrupted or special crafted XFS filesystem. ([CVE-2013-1819](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1819)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 13.04
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-233-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [3.5.0-233.49](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-233.49) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
