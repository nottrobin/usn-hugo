### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

 A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s pseudo tty (pty) device. An unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially gain administrator privileges. ([CVE-2014-0196](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-0196))

Matthew Daley reported an information leak in the floppy disk driver of the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1738](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1738))

Matthew Daley reported a flaw in the handling of ioctl commands by the floppy disk driver in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges if the floppy disk module is loaded. ([CVE-2014-1737](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1737))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s IPC reference counting. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (OOM system crash). ([CVE-2013-4483](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4483))

Al Viro discovered an error in how CIFS in the Linux kernel handles uncached write operations. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash), obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, or possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2014-0069](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-0069))

A flaw was discovered in the handling of network packets when mergeable buffers are disabled for virtual machines in the Linux kernel. Guest OS users may exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (host OS crash) or possibly gain privilege on the host OS. ([CVE-2014-0077](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-0077))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s handling of the SCTP handshake. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2014-0101](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-0101))

A flaw was discovered in the handling of routing information in Linux kernel&#39;s IPv6 stack. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory consumption) via a flood of ICMPv6 router advertisement packets. ([CVE-2014-2309](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-2309))

An error was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s DCCP protocol support. A remote attacked could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-2523](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-2523))

Max Sydorenko discovered a race condition in the Atheros 9k wireless driver in the Linux kernel. This race could be exploited by remote attackers to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2014-2672](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-2672))

An error was discovered in the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol stack in the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact. ([CVE-2014-2678](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-2678))

Yaara Rozenblum discovered a race condition in the Linux kernel&#39;s Generic IEEE 802.11 Networking Stack (mac80211). Remote attackers could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2014-2706](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-2706))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s ping sockets. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain privileges via a crafted application. ([CVE-2014-2851](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-2851))

Jouni Malinen reported a flaw in the handling of fragmentation in the mac8Linux subsystem of the kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain potential sensitive cleartext information by reading packets. ([CVE-2014-8709](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8709)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-1446-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [3.2.0-1446.65](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1446.65) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
