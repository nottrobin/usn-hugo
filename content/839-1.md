    J. David Hester discovered that Samba incorrectly handled users that lack home directories when the automated [homes] share is enabled.

### samba vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 9.04
* Ubuntu 8.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* samba 

### Details

J. David Hester discovered that Samba incorrectly handled users that lack home directories when the automated [homes] share is enabled. An authenticated user could connect to that share name and gain access to the whole filesystem. ([CVE-2009-2813](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-2813))

Tim Prouty discovered that the smbd daemon in Samba incorrectly handled certain unexpected network replies. A remote attacker could send malicious replies to the server and cause smbd to use all available CPU, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-2906](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-2906))

Ronald Volgers discovered that the mount.cifs utility, when installed as a setuid program, would not verify user permissions before opening a credentials file. A local user could exploit this to use or read the contents of unauthorized credential files. ([CVE-2009-2948](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-2948))

Reinhard Ni√ül discovered that the smbclient utility contained format string vulnerabilities in its file name handling. Because of security features in Ubuntu, exploitation of this vulnerability is limited. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted file name, smbclient could be made to crash, possibly leading to a denial of service. This only affected Ubuntu 8.10. ([CVE-2009-1886](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1886))

Jeremy Allison discovered that the smbd daemon in Samba incorrectly handled permissions to modify access control lists when dos filemode is enabled. A remote attacker could exploit this to modify access control lists. This only affected Ubuntu 8.10 and Ubuntu 9.04. ([CVE-2009-1886](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1886))
