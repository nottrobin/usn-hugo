    Mateusz Jurczyk and Gynvael Coldwind discovered that FFmpeg incorrectly handled certain malformed DV files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted DV file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.
