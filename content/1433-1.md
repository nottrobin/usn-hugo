### linux-lts-backport-oneiric vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-backport-oneiric 

### Details

 A flaw was found in the Linux&#39;s kernels ext4 file system when mounted with a journal. A local, unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-4086](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4086))

Sasha Levin discovered a flaw in the permission checking for device assignments requested via the kvm ioctl in the Linux kernel. A local user could use this flaw to crash the system causing a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-4347](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4347))

Stephan BÃ¤rwolf discovered a flaw in the KVM (kernel-based virtual machine) subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local unprivileged user can crash use this flaw to crash VMs causing a deny of service. ([CVE-2012-0045](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0045))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s cifs file system. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to crash the system leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-1090](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1090))

H. Peter Anvin reported a flaw in the Linux kernel that could crash the system. A local user could exploit this flaw to crash the system. ([CVE-2012-1097](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1097))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s cgroups subset. A local attacker could use this flaw to crash the system. ([CVE-2012-1146](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1146))

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel&#39;s handling of paged memory. A local unprivileged user, or a privileged user within a KVM guest, could exploit this flaw to crash the system. ([CVE-2012-1179](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1179))

Tetsuo Handa reported a flaw in the OOM (out of memory) killer of the Linux kernel. A local unprivileged user can exploit this flaw to cause system unstability and denial of services. ([CVE-2012-4398](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4398)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-19-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric) <span> [3.0.0-19.33~lucid1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric/3.0.0-19.33~lucid1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-19-server](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric) <span> [3.0.0-19.33~lucid1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric/3.0.0-19.33~lucid1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-19-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric) <span> [3.0.0-19.33~lucid1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric/3.0.0-19.33~lucid1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-19-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric) <span> [3.0.0-19.33~lucid1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric/3.0.0-19.33~lucid1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
