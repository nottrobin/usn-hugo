    It was discovered that Puppet did not drop privileges when executing commands as different users. If an attacker had control of the execution manifests or the executed command, this could be used to execute code with elevated group permissions (typically root).

### Details

It was discovered that Puppet did not drop privileges when executing commands as different users. If an attacker had control of the execution manifests or the executed command, this could be used to execute code with elevated group permissions (typically root). ([CVE-2012-1053](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1053))

It was discovered that Puppet unsafely opened files when the k5login type is used to manage files. A local attacker could exploit this to overwrite arbitrary files and escalate privileges. ([CVE-2012-1054](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1054))
