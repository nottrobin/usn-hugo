### libxml2 regression

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 13.04
* Ubuntu 12.10
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

USN-1904-1 introduced a regression in libxml2. 

### Software description

* libxml2 

### Details

USN-1904-1 fixed vulnerabilities in libxml2. The update caused a regression for certain users. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that libxml2 would load XML external entities by default. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted document, an attacker could possibly obtain access to arbitrary files or cause resource consumption. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 12.10. ([CVE-2013-0339](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0339))

 It was discovered that libxml2 incorrectly handled documents that end abruptly. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted document, an attacker could possibly cause libxml2 to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-2877](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2877))
