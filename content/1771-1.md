### Details

Loganathan Parthipan discovered that Nova did not properly validate VNC tokens after an instance was deleted. An authenticated attacker could exploit this to access other virtual machines under certain circumstances. This issue did not affect Ubuntu 11.10. ([CVE-2013-0335](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0335))

Vish Ishaya discovered that Nova did not always enforce quotas on fixed IPs. An authenticated attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via resource consumption. Nova will now enforce a quota limit of 10 fixed IPs per instance, which is configurable via &#39;quota_fixed_ips&#39; in /etc/nova/nova.conf. ([CVE-2013-1838](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1838))
