### linux-source-2.6.15 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Details

A Denial of service vulnerability was reported in iptables&#39; SCTP conntrack module. On computers which use this iptables module, a remote attacker could expoit this to trigger a kernel crash. ([CVE-2006-2934](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-2934))

A buffer overflow has been discovered in the dvd_read_bca() function. By inserting a specially crafted DVD, USB stick, or similar automatically mounted removable device, a local user could crash the machine or potentially even execute arbitrary code with full root privileges. ([CVE-2006-2935](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-2935))

The ftdi_sio driver for serial USB ports did not limit the amount of pending data to be written. A local user could exploit this to drain all available kernel memory and thus render the system unusable. ([CVE-2006-2936](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-2936))

Additionally, this update fixes a range of bugs.
