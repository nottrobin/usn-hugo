### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.10

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

Jon Howell reported a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s KVM (Kernel-based virtual machine) subsystem&#39;s handling of the XSAVE CPU feature. On hosts without the XSAVE CPU feature, using qemu userspace, an unprivileged local attacker could exploit this flaw to crash the system. ([CVE-2012-4461](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4461))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s handling of script execution when module loading is enabled. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a leak of kernel stack contents. ([CVE-2012-4530](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4530))

Florian Weimer discovered that hypervkvpd, which is distributed in the Linux kernel, was not correctly validating source addresses of netlink packets. An untrusted local user can cause a denial of service by causing hypervkvpd to exit. ([CVE-2012-5532](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5532)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.10
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-22-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-22.34](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-22.34) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-22-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-22.34](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-22.34) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-22-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-22.34](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-22.34) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-22-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-22.34](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-22.34) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-22-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-22.34](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-22.34) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
