### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.10

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

Hugo Dias discovered that the ATM subsystem did not correctly manage socket counts. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a system hang, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-5079](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5079))

It was discovered that the inotify subsystem contained watch removal race conditions. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-5182](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5182))

Dann Frazier discovered that in certain situations sendmsg did not correctly release allocated memory. A local attacker could exploit this to force the system to run out of free memory, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-5300](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5300))

Helge Deller discovered that PA-RISC stack unwinding was not handled correctly. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading do a denial of service. This did not affect official Ubuntu kernels, but was fixed in the source for anyone performing HPPA kernel builds. ([CVE-2008-5395](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5395))

It was discovered that the ATA subsystem did not correctly set timeouts. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a system hang, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-5700](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5700))

It was discovered that the ib700 watchdog timer did not correctly check buffer sizes. A local attacker could send a specially crafted ioctl to the device to cause a system crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-5702](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5702)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 8.10
 : [linux-image-2.6.27-11-server](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [2.6.27-11.27](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/2.6.27-11.27) </span> 
 : [linux-image-2.6.27-11-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [2.6.27-11.27](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/2.6.27-11.27) </span> 
 : [linux-image-2.6.27-11-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [2.6.27-11.27](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/2.6.27-11.27) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
