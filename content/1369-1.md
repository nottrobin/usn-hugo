### thunderbird vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.10

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird. 

### Software description

* thunderbird 

### Details

Nicolas Gregoire and Aki Helin discovered that when processing a malformed embedded XSLT stylesheet, Thunderbird can crash due to memory corruption. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2012-0449](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0449))

It was discovered that memory corruption could occur during the decoding of Ogg Vorbis files. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted file, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2012-0444](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0444))

Tim Abraldes discovered that when encoding certain image types the resulting data was always a fixed size. There is the possibility of sensitive data from uninitialized memory being appended to these images. ([CVE-2012-0447](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0447))

It was discovered that Thunderbird did not properly perform XPConnect security checks. An attacker could exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks through web pages and Thunderbird extensions. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-0446](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0446))

It was discovered that Thunderbird did not properly handle node removal in the DOM. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2011-3659](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3659))

Alex Dvorov discovered that Thunderbird did not properly handle sub-frames in form submissions. An attacker could exploit this to conduct phishing attacks using HTML5 frames. ([CVE-2012-0445](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0445))

Ben Hawkes, Christian Holler, Honza Bombas, Jason Orendorff, Jesse Ruderman, Jan Odvarko, Peter Van Der Beken, Bob Clary, and Bill McCloskey discovered memory safety issues affecting Thunderbird. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2012-0443](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0442">CVE-2012-0442</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0443))

Andrew McCreight and Olli Pettay discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the XBL bindings. An attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2012-0452](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0452))

Jueri Aedla discovered that libpng, which is in Thunderbird, did not properly verify the size used when allocating memory during chunk decompression. If a user or automated system using libpng were tricked into opening a specially crafted image, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service or execute code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2011-3026](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3026)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 11.10
 : [thunderbird](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/thunderbird) <span> [10.0.2+build1-0ubuntu0.11.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/thunderbird/10.0.2+build1-0ubuntu0.11.10.1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to restart Thunderbird to make all the necessary changes.
