    Andy Lutomirski discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel&#39;s Thread Local Storage (TLS) implementation allowing users to bypass the espfix to obtain information that could be used to bypass the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) protection mechanism. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-8133](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8133))

### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

Andy Lutomirski discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel&#39;s Thread Local Storage (TLS) implementation allowing users to bypass the espfix to obtain information that could be used to bypass the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) protection mechanism. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-8133](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8133))

A flaw was discovered with file renaming in the linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (deadlock and system hang). ([CVE-2014-8559](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8559))

Prasad J Pandit reported a flaw in the rock_continue function of the Linux kernel&#39;s ISO 9660 CDROM file system. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash or hang). ([CVE-2014-9420](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-9420)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-76-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-76.111](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-76.111) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-76-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-76.111](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-76.111) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-76-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-76.111](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-76.111) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-76-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-76.111](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-76.111) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-76-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-76.111](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-76.111) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-76-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-76.111](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-76.111) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-76-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-76.111](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-76.111) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
