### openvpn regression

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 7.10
* Ubuntu 7.04

### Software description

* openvpn 

### Details

USN-612-3 addressed a weakness in OpenSSL certificate and key generation in OpenVPN by adding checks for vulnerable certificates and keys to OpenVPN. A regression was introduced in OpenVPN when using TLS with password protected certificates which caused OpenVPN to not start when used with applications such as NetworkManager.

Original advisory details: A weakness has been discovered in the random number generator used by OpenSSL on Debian and Ubuntu systems. As a result of this weakness, certain encryption keys are much more common than they should be, such that an attacker could guess the key through a brute-force attack given minimal knowledge of the system. This particularly affects the use of encryption keys in OpenSSH, OpenVPN and SSL certificates. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
 : [openvpn](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openvpn) <span> [2.1~rc7-1ubuntu3.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openvpn/2.1~rc7-1ubuntu3.3) </span> 

Ubuntu 7.10
 : [openvpn](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openvpn) <span> [2.0.9-8ubuntu0.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openvpn/2.0.9-8ubuntu0.3) </span> 

Ubuntu 7.04
 : [openvpn](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openvpn) <span> [2.0.9-5ubuntu0.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openvpn/2.0.9-5ubuntu0.3) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the necessary changes.
