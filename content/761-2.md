### php5 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 9.04

### Software description

* php5 

### Details

USN-761-1 fixed vulnerabilities in PHP. This update provides the corresponding updates for Ubuntu 9.04.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that PHP did not sanitize certain error messages when display_errors is enabled, which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks when processing the output. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing server output during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data (such as passwords), within the same domain. ([CVE-2009-1271](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5814">CVE-2008-5814</a>) It was discovered that PHP did not properly handle certain malformed strings when being parsed by the json_decode function. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw and cause the PHP server to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 and 8.10.
