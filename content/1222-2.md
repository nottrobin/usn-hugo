Original advisory details:

 Benjamin Smedberg, Bob Clary, Jesse Ruderman, Bob Clary, Andrew McCreight, Andreas Gal, Gary Kwong, Igor Bukanov, Jason Orendorff, Jesse Ruderman, and Marcia Knous discovered multiple memory vulnerabilities in the browser rendering engine. An attacker could use these to possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2011-3232](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2995">CVE-2011-2995</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2997">CVE-2011-2997</a>) Boris Zbarsky discovered that a frame named &quot;location&quot; could shadow the window.location object unless a script in a page grabbed a reference to the true object before the frame was created. This is in violation of the Same Origin Policy. A malicious website could possibly use this to access another website or the local file system. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2999">CVE-2011-2999</a>) Ian Graham discovered that when multiple Location headers were present, Firefox would use the second one resulting in a possible CRLF injection attack. CRLF injection issues can result in a wide variety of attacks, such as XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities, browser cache poisoning, and cookie theft. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3000">CVE-2011-3000</a>) Mariusz Mlynski discovered that if the user could be convinced to hold down the enter key, a malicious website could potential pop up a download dialog and the default open action would be selected or lead to the installation of an arbitrary add-on. This would result in potentially malicious content being run with privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2372">CVE-2011-2372</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3001">CVE-2011-3001</a>) Michael Jordon and Ben Hawkes discovered flaws in WebGL. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious page, an attacker could cause the browser to crash. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3002">CVE-2011-3002</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3003">CVE-2011-3003</a>) It was discovered that Firefox did not properly free memory when processing ogg files. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious page, an attacker could cause the browser to crash. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3005">CVE-2011-3005</a>) David Rees and Aki Helin discovered a problems in the JavaScript engine. An attacker could exploit this to crash the browser or potentially escalate privileges within the browser. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3232))
