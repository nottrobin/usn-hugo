    It was discovered that libxml2 contained an off by one error. If a user or application linked against libxml2 were tricked into opening a specially crafted XML file, an attacker could cause the application to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

### libxml2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.10
* Ubuntu 11.04
* Ubuntu 10.10
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Summary

Applications using libxml2 could be made to crash or run programs as your login if they opened a specially crafted file.

### Software description

* libxml2 

### Details

It was discovered that libxml2 contained an off by one error. If a user or application linked against libxml2 were tricked into opening a specially crafted XML file, an attacker could cause the application to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2011-0216](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0216))

It was discovered that libxml2 is vulnerable to double-free conditions when parsing certain XML documents. This could allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2834](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2821">CVE-2011-2821</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2834))

It was discovered that libxml2 did not properly detect end of file when parsing certain XML documents. An attacker could exploit this to crash applications linked against libxml2. ([CVE-2011-3905](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3905))

It was discovered that libxml2 did not properly decode entity references with long names. If a user or application linked against libxml2 were tricked into opening a specially crafted XML file, an attacker could cause the application to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2011-3919](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3919))
