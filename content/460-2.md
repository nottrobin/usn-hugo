### samba regression

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 7.04

### Details

USN-460-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in Samba. The upstream changes for [CVE-2007-2444](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2444) had an unexpected side-effect in Feisty. Shares configured with the &quot;force group&quot; option no longer behaved correctly. This update corrects the problem. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Paul Griffith and Andrew Hogue discovered that Samba did not fully drop root privileges while translating SIDs. A remote authenticated user could issue SMB operations during a small window of opportunity and gain root privileges. ([CVE-2007-2444](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2444))

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 7.04
 : samba <span>3.0.24-2ubuntu1.2</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the necessary changes.
