### linux-lts-raring vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-raring 

### Details

Vasily Kulikov discovered a flaw in the Linux Kernel&#39;s perf tool that allows for privilege escalation. A local user could exploit this flaw to run commands as root when using the perf tool. ([CVE-2013-1060](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1060))

A flaw was discovered in the Xen subsystem of the Linux kernel when it provides read-only access to a disk that supports TRIM or SCSI UNMAP to a guest OS. A privileged user in the guest OS could exploit this flaw to destroy data on the disk, even though the guest OS should not be able to write to the disk. ([CVE-2013-2140](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2140))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel when an IPv6 socket is used to connect to an IPv4 destination. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-2232](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2232))

An information leak was discovered in the IPSec key_socket implementation in the Linux kernel. An local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially sensitive information in kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2234](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2234))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in setsockopt UDP_CORK option in the Linux kernel&#39;s IPv6 stack. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4162](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4162))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in the IPv6 subsystem of the Linux kernel when the IPV6_MTU setsockopt option has been specified in combination with the UDP_CORK option. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4163](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4163)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.8.0-30-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-raring) <span> [3.8.0-30.44~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-raring/3.8.0-30.44~precise1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
