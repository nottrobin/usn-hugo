### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.10

### Summary

A security issue was fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

 Peter Huewe discovered an information leak in the handling of reading security-related TPM data. A local, unprivileged user could read the results of a previous TPM command. ([CVE-2011-1162](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1162))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that taskstats did not enforce access restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain information, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2011-2494](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2494))

Mathieu Desnoyers discovered that the kernel sockets implementation incorrectly dereferenced user pointers. A local attacker could possibly exploit this to crash the system. ([CVE-2011-4594](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4594))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s KVM (kernel virtual machine). An administrative user in the guest OS could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service in the host OS. ([CVE-2012-2121](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2121))

Ben Hutchings reported a flaw in the Linux kernel with some network drivers that support TSO (TCP segment offload). A local or peer user could exploit this flaw to to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-3412](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3412))

Jay Fenlason and Doug Ledford discovered a bug in the Linux kernel implementation of RDS sockets. A local unprivileged user could potentially use this flaw to read privileged information from the kernel. ([CVE-2012-3430](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3430))

A flaw was discovered in the madvise feature of the Linux kernel&#39;s memory subsystem. An unprivileged local use could exploit the flaw to cause a denial of service (crash the system). ([CVE-2012-3511](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3511)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 11.10
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-1206-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [3.0.0-1206.12](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/3.0.0-1206.12) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
