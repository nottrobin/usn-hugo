description: A local privilege escalation vulnerability has been discovered in the
  pixmap allocation handling of the X server. By allocating a huge pixmap, a local
  user could trigger an integer overflow that resulted in a memory allocation that
  was too small for the requested pixmap. This resulted in a buffer overflow which
  could eventually be exploited to execute arbitrary code with full root privileges.
