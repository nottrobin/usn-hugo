### Details

Jesse Ruderman and Bob Clary discovered memory safety issues affecting Thunderbird. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2012-0442](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0442))

It was discovered that Thunderbird did not properly handle node removal in the DOM. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2011-3659](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3659))

It was discovered that memory corruption could occur during the decoding of Ogg Vorbis files. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted file, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2012-0444](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0444))

Nicolas Gregoire and Aki Helin discovered that when processing a malformed embedded XSLT stylesheet, Thunderbird can crash due to memory corruption. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2012-0449](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0449))

Gregory Fleischer discovered that requests using IPv6 hostname syntax through certain proxies might generate errors. An attacker might be able to use this to read sensitive data from the error messages. ([CVE-2011-3670](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3670))
