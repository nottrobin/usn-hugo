description: |
    Zygmunt Krynicki discovered that ubuntu-core-launcher did not properly sanitize its input and contained a logic error when determining the mount point of bind mounts when using snaps on Ubuntu classic systems (eg, traditional desktop and server). If a user were tricked into installing a malicious snap with a crafted snap name, an attacker could perform a delayed attack to steal data or execute code within the security context of another snap. This issue did not affect Ubuntu Core systems.
