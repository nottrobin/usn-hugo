### openjdk-6, openjdk-6b18 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.04
* Ubuntu 10.10
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Multiple OpenJDK 6 vulnerabilities have been fixed. 

### Software description

* openjdk-6 

* openjdk-6b18 

### Details

It was discovered that a heap overflow in the AWT FileDialog.show() method could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service through an application crash or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2011-0815](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0815))

It was dicovered that integer overflows in the JPEGImageReader readImage() function and the SunLayoutEngine nativeLayout() function could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service through an application crash or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2011-0862](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0822">CVE-2011-0822</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0862))

It was discovered that memory corruption could occur when interpreting bytecode in the HotSpot VM. This could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service through an application crash or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2011-0864](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0864))

It was discovered that the deserialization code allowed the creation of mutable SignedObjects. This could allow an attacker to possibly execute code with elevated privileges. ([CVE-2011-0865](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0865))

It was discovered that the toString method in the NetworkInterface class would reveal multiple addresses if they were bound to the interface. This could give an attacker more information about the networking environment. ([CVE-2011-0867](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0867))

It was discovered that the Java 2D code to transform an image with a scale close to 0 could trigger an integer overflow. This could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service through an application crash or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2011-0868](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0868))

It was discovered that the SOAP with Attachments API for Java (SAAJ) implementation allowed the modification of proxy settings via unprivileged SOAP messages. ([CVE-2011-0870](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0869">CVE-2011-0869</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0870))

It was the discovered that the Swing ImageIcon class created MediaTracker objects that potentially leaked privileged ApplicationContexts. This could possibly allow an attacker access to restricted resources or services. ([CVE-2011-0871](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0871))

It was discovered that non-blocking sockets marked as not urgent could still get selected for read operations. This could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-0872](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0872))
