title: "USN-2767-1: GDK-PixBuf vulnerabilities"
releases: [ ubuntu-12.04-lts ]

description: |
    Gustavo Grieco discovered that the GDK-PixBuf library did not properly handle scaling tga image files, leading to a heap overflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a tga image file, a remote attacker could use this flaw to cause GDK-PixBuf to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

### Details

Gustavo Grieco discovered that the GDK-PixBuf library did not properly handle scaling tga image files, leading to a heap overflow.

Gustavo Grieco discovered that the GDK-PixBuf library contained an integer overflow when handling certain GIF images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a GIF image file, a remote attacker could use this flaw to cause GDK-PixBuf to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.
