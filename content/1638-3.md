### firefox regressions

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.10
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 11.10
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Regressions were introduced in the last Firefox update. 

### Software description

* firefox 

### Details

USN-1638-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. The new packages introduced regressions in cookies handling and the User Agent string. This update fixes the problem.

Original advisory details:

 Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bob Clary, Kyle Huey, Ed Morley, Chris Lord, Boris Zbarsky, Julian Seward, Bill McCloskey, and Andrew McCreight discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-5838](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5842">CVE-2012-5842</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5843">CVE-2012-5843</a>) Atte Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow while rendering GIF format images. An attacker could exploit this to possibly execute arbitrary code as the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4202">CVE-2012-4202</a>) It was discovered that the evalInSandbox function&#39;s JavaScript sandbox context could be circumvented. An attacker could exploit this to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or steal a copy of a local file if the user has installed an add-on vulnerable to this attack. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4201">CVE-2012-4201</a>) Jonathan Stephens discovered that combining vectors involving the setting of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) properties in conjunction with SVG text could cause Firefox to crash. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privliges of the user invoking the program. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5836">CVE-2012-5836</a>) It was discovered that if a javascript: URL is selected from the list of Firefox &quot;new tab&quot; page, the script will inherit the privileges of the privileged &quot;new tab&quot; page. This allows for the execution of locally installed programs if a user can be convinced to save a bookmark of a malicious javascript: URL. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4203">CVE-2012-4203</a>) Scott Bell discovered a memory corruption issue in the JavaScript engine. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4204">CVE-2012-4204</a>) Gabor Krizsanits discovered that XMLHttpRequest objects created within sandboxes have the system principal instead of the sandbox principal. This can lead to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) or information theft via an add-on running untrusted code in a sandbox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4205">CVE-2012-4205</a>) Peter Van der Beken discovered XrayWrapper implementation in Firefox does not consider the compartment during property filtering. An attacker could use this to bypass intended chrome-only restrictions on reading DOM object properties via a crafted web site. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4208">CVE-2012-4208</a>) Bobby Holley discovered that cross-origin wrappers were allowing write actions on objects when only read actions should have been properly allowed. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5841">CVE-2012-5841</a>) Masato Kinugawa discovered that when HZ-GB-2312 charset encoding is used for text, the &quot;~&quot; character will destroy another character near the chunk delimiter. This can lead to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack in pages encoded in HZ-GB-2312. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4207">CVE-2012-4207</a>) Masato Kinugawa discovered that scripts entered into the Developer Toolbar could run in a chrome privileged context. An attacker could use this vulnerability to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or execute arbitrary code as the user invoking Firefox. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5837">CVE-2012-5837</a>) Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the location property can be accessed by binary plugins through top.location with a frame whose name attribute&#39;s value is set to &quot;top&quot;. This can allow for possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks through plugins. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4209">CVE-2012-4209</a>) Mariusz Mlynski discovered that when a maliciously crafted stylesheet is inspected in the Style Inspector, HTML and CSS can run in a chrome privileged context without being properly sanitized first. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privliges of the user invoking the program. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4210">CVE-2012-4210</a>) Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free and buffer overflow issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious page, an attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4214">CVE-2012-4214</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4215">CVE-2012-4215</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4216">CVE-2012-4216</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5829">CVE-2012-5829</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5839">CVE-2012-5839</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5840">CVE-2012-5840</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4212">CVE-2012-4212</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4213">CVE-2012-4213</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4217">CVE-2012-4217</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4218">CVE-2012-4218</a>) Several memory corruption flaws were discovered in Firefox. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious page, an attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5830">CVE-2012-5830</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5833">CVE-2012-5833</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5835">CVE-2012-5835</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5838))
