    Andrew Osmond, Olli Pettay, Andrew Sutherland, Christian Holler, David Major, Andrew McCreight, and Cameron McCormack discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.
