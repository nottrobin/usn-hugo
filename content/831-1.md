### Details

Drew Yao discovered several flaws in the way OpenEXR handled certain malformed EXR image files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted EXR image file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-1721](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1720">CVE-2009-1720</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1721))

It was discovered that OpenEXR did not properly handle certain malformed EXR image files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted EXR image file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2009-1722](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1722))
