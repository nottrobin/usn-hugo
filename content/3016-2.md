    Jesse Hertz and Tim Newsham discovered that the Linux netfilter implementation did not correctly perform validation when handling 32 bit compatibility IPT_SO_SET_REPLACE events on 64 bit platforms. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges.

### linux-raspi2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-raspi2 

### Details

Jesse Hertz and Tim Newsham discovered that the Linux netfilter implementation did not correctly perform validation when handling 32 bit compatibility IPT_SO_SET_REPLACE events on 64 bit platforms. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-4997](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4997))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the core USB implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-4482](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4482))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the timer handling implementation in the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-4578](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4569">CVE-2016-4569</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4578))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the X.25 Call Request handling in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-4580](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4580))

It was discovered that an information leak exists in the Rock Ridge implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker who is able to mount a malicious iso9660 file system image could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-4913](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4913))

Baozeng Ding discovered that the Transparent Inter-process Communication (TIPC) implementation in the Linux kernel did not verify socket existence before use in some situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4951](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4951))

Jesse Hertz and Tim Newsham discovered that the Linux netfilter implementation did not correctly perform validation when handling IPT_SO_SET_REPLACE events. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-4998](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4998)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-4.4.0-1016-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-raspi2) <span> [4.4.0-1016.22](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-raspi2/4.4.0-1016.22) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
