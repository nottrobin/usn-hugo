### mozilla-thunderbird vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
* Ubuntu 5.10

### Details

Georgi Guninski and David Bienvenu discovered that long Content-Type and RFC2047-encoded headers we vulnerable to heap overflows. By tricking the user into opening a specially crafted email, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2006-6506](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-6506))

Various flaws have been reported that allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with user privileges or bypass internal XSS protections by tricking the user into opening a malicious email containing JavaScript. Please note that JavaScript is disabled by default for emails, and it is not recommended to enable it.
