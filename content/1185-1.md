### thunderbird vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.04
* Ubuntu 10.10
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Multiple vulnerabilities have been fixed in Thunderbird. 

### Software description

* thunderbird 

### Details

Gary Kwong, Igor Bukanov, and Bob Clary discovered multiple memory vulnerabilities in the Gecko rendering engine. An attacker could use these to possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2011-2982](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2982))

It was discovered that a vulnerability in event management code could permit JavaScript to be run in the wrong context. This could potentially allow a malicious website to run code as another website or with escalated privileges in a chrome-privileged context. ([CVE-2011-2981](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2981))

It was discovered that an SVG text manipulation routine contained a dangling pointer vulnerability. An attacker could potentially use this to crash Thunderbird or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2011-0084](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0084))

It was discovered that web content could receive chrome privileges if it registered for drop events and a browser tab element was dropped into the content area. This could potentially allow a malicious website to run code with escalated privileges within Thunderbird. ([CVE-2011-2984](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2984))

It was discovered that appendChild contained a dangling pointer vulnerability. An attacker could potentially use this to crash Thunderbird or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2011-2378](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2378))

It was discovered that data from other domains could be read when RegExp.input was set. This could potentially allow a malicious website access to private data from other domains. ([CVE-2011-2983](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2983))
