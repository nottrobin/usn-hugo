### tomcat6 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.10
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 9.10

### Summary

An attacker could send crafted input to Tomcat and cause it to crash or read and write arbitrary files.

### Software description

* tomcat6 

### Details

It was discovered that the Tomcat SecurityManager did not properly restrict the working directory. An attacker could use this flaw to read or write files outside of the intended working directory. ([CVE-2010-3718](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-3718))

It was discovered that Tomcat did not properly escape certain parameters in the Manager application which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks when processing the output. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing server output during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data (such as passwords), within the same domain. ([CVE-2011-0013](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0013))

It was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly enforced the maxHttpHeaderSize limit in certain configurations. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause Tomcat to consume all available memory, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-0534](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0534))
