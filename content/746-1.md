description: |
    It was discovered that the 4xm demuxer in xine-lib did not correctly handle a large current_track value in a 4xm file, resulting in an integer overflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted 4xm movie file, an attacker could crash xine-lib or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

### xine-lib vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 7.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* xine-lib 

### Details

It was discovered that the 4xm demuxer in xine-lib did not correctly handle a large current_track value in a 4xm file, resulting in an integer overflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted 4xm movie file, an attacker could crash xine-lib or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-0698](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0698))

USN-710-1 provided updated xine-lib packages to fix multiple security vulnerabilities. The security patch to fix [CVE-2008-5239](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5239) introduced a regression causing some media files to be unplayable. This update corrects the problem. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details: It was discovered that the input handlers in xine-lib did not correctly handle certain error codes, resulting in out-of-bounds reads and heap- based buffer overflows. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted file, stream, or URL, an attacker could execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-5239](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5239))
