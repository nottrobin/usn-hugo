### xpdf, poppler, kdegraphics vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04
* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

The splash image handler in xpdf did not check the validity of coordinates. By tricking a user into opening a specially crafted PDF file, an attacker could exploit this to trigger a buffer overflow which could lead to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user.

The poppler library and kpdf also contain xpdf code, and thus are affected by the same vulnerability.
