([CVE-2015-1291](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1291))

An issue was discovered in NavigatorServiceWorker::serviceWorker in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions. ([CVE-2015-1292](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1292))

An issue was discovered in the DOM implementation in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions. ([CVE-2015-1293](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1293))

A use-after-free was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1294](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1294))

A use-after-free was discovered in the shared-timer implementation in Blink.

([CVE-2015-1300](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1300))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1301](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1301))
