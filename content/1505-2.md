We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that multiple flaws existed in the CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) implementation in OpenJDK. An attacker could create a Java application or applet that used these flaws to bypass Java sandbox restrictions or modify immutable object data. ([CVE-2012-1724](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1711">CVE-2012-1711</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1719">CVE-2012-1719</a>) It was discovered that multiple flaws existed in the OpenJDK font manager&#39;s layout lookup implementation. A attacker could specially craft a font file that could cause a denial of service through crashing the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1713">CVE-2012-1713</a>) It was discovered that the SynthLookAndFeel class from Swing in OpenJDK did not properly prevent access to certain UI elements from outside the current application context. An attacker could create a Java application or applet that used this flaw to cause a denial of service through crashing the JVM or bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1716">CVE-2012-1716</a>) It was discovered that OpenJDK runtime library classes could create temporary files with insecure permissions. A local attacker could use this to gain access to sensitive information. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1717">CVE-2012-1717</a>) It was discovered that OpenJDK did not handle CRLs (Certificate Revocation Lists) properly. A remote attacker could use this to gain access to sensitive information. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1718">CVE-2012-1718</a>) It was discovered that the OpenJDK HotSpot Virtual Machine did not properly verify the bytecode of the class to be executed. A remote attacker could create a Java application or applet that used this to cause a denial of service through crashing the JVM or bypass Java sandbox restrictions. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1723">CVE-2012-1723</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1725">CVE-2012-1725</a>) It was discovered that the OpenJDK XML (Extensible Markup Language) parser did not properly handle some XML documents. An attacker could create an XML document that caused a denial of service in a Java application or applet parsing the document. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1724)) As part of this update, the IcedTea web browser applet plugin was updated for Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, Ubuntu 11.04, and Ubuntu 11.10.
