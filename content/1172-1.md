### Details

It was discovered that logrotate incorrectly handled the creation of new log files. Local users could possibly read log files if they were opened before permissions were in place. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2011-1098](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1098))

It was discovered that logrotate incorrectly handled certain log file names when used with the shred option. Local attackers able to create log files with specially crafted filenames could use this issue to execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, 10.10, and 11.04. ([CVE-2011-1154](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1154))

It was discovered that logrotate incorrectly handled certain malformed log filenames. Local attackers able to create log files with specially crafted filenames could use this issue to cause logrotate to stop processing log files, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1155](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1155))

It was discovered that logrotate incorrectly handled symlinks and hard links when processing log files. A local attacker having write access to a log file directory could use this issue to overwrite or read arbitrary files. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2011-1548](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1548))
