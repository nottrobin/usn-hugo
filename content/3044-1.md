### Details

Gustavo Grieco discovered an out-of-bounds read during XML parsing in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or obtain sensitive information.

Toni Huttunen discovered that once a favicon is requested from a site, the remote server can keep the network connection open even after the page is closed. A remote attacked could potentially exploit this to track users, resulting in information disclosure. ([CVE-2016-2830](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2830))

Christian Holler, Tyson Smith, Boris Zbarsky, Byron Campen, Julian Seward, Carsten Book, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Andrew McCreight, and Phil Ringnalda discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2836](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2835">CVE-2016-2835</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2836))
