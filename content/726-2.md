### curl regression

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.10

### Software description

* curl 

### Details

USN-726-1 fixed a vulnerability in curl. Due to an incomplete fix, a regression was introduced in Ubuntu 8.10 that caused certain types of URLs to fail. This update fixes the problem. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that curl did not enforce any restrictions when following URL redirects. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a URL to an untrusted server, an attacker could use redirects to gain access to abitrary files. This update changes curl behavior to prevent following &quot;file&quot; URLs after a redirect. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 8.10
 : [libcurl3-gnutls](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/curl) <span> [7.18.2-1ubuntu4.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/curl/7.18.2-1ubuntu4.3) </span> 
 : [libcurl3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/curl) <span> [7.18.2-1ubuntu4.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/curl/7.18.2-1ubuntu4.3) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the necessary changes.
