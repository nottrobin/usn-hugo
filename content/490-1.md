### firefox vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 7.04
* Ubuntu 6.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Details

Various flaws were discovered in the layout and JavaScript engines. By tricking a user into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2007-3735](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-3734">CVE-2007-3734</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-3735))

Flaws were discovered in the JavaScript methods addEventListener and setTimeout which could be used to inject script into another site in violation of the browser&#39;s same-origin policy. A malicious web site could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data (such as passwords), of other web pages. ([CVE-2007-3736](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-3736))

Ronen Zilberman and Michal Zalewski discovered timing attacks in the JavaScript engine&#39;s use of about:blank frames. A malicious web site could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data (such as passwords), of other web pages. ([CVE-2007-3089](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-3089))

A flaw was discovered in the JavaScript event handling code. By tricking a user into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2007-3737](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-3737))

Ronald van den Heetkamp discovered that filename URLs including an encoded null byte could confuse the extension matching code. By tricking a user into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could execute arbitrary helper programs. ([CVE-2007-3285](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-3285))

Michal Zalewski discovered flaws in the same-origin handling of cached &quot;wyciwyg://&quot; documents. A malicious web site could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data (such as passwords), of other web pages. ([CVE-2007-3656](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-3656))

Various flaws were discovered in the XPCNativeWrapper method. By tricking a user into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2007-3738](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-3738)).
