    Stefan Esser discovered two buffer overflows in the htmlentities() and htmlspecialchars() functions. By supplying specially crafted input to PHP applications which process that input with these functions, a remote attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application.

### php5 vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
* Ubuntu 5.10

### Details

Stefan Esser discovered two buffer overflows in the htmlentities() and htmlspecialchars() functions. By supplying specially crafted input to PHP applications which process that input with these functions, a remote attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application. ([CVE-2006-5465](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-5465))

This update also fixes bugs in the chdir() and tempnam() functions, which did not perform proper open_basedir checks. This could allow local scripts to bypass intended restrictions.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 6.10
 : php5-cli <span>5.1.6-1ubuntu2.1</span>
 : libapache2-mod-php5 <span>5.1.6-1ubuntu2.1</span>

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : php5-cli <span>5.1.2-1ubuntu3.4</span>
 : libapache2-mod-php5 <span>5.1.2-1ubuntu3.4</span>

Ubuntu 5.10
 : php5-cli <span>5.0.5-2ubuntu1.6</span>
 : libapache2-mod-php5 <span>5.0.5-2ubuntu1.6</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the necessary changes.
