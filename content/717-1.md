A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Software description

* firefox-3.0 

* xulrunner-1.9 

### Details

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine. These problems could allow an attacker to crash the browser and possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2009-0353](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0352">CVE-2009-0352</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0353))

A flaw was discovered in the JavaScript engine. An attacker could bypass the same-origin policy in Firefox by utilizing a chrome XBL method and execute arbitrary JavaScript within the context of another website. ([CVE-2009-0354](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0354))

A flaw was discovered in the browser engine when restoring closed tabs. If a user were tricked into restoring a tab to a malicious website with form input controls, an attacker could steal local files on the user&#39;s system. ([CVE-2009-0355](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0355))

Wladimir Palant discovered that Firefox did not restrict access to cookies in HTTP response headers. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious web page, a remote attacker could view sensitive information. ([CVE-2009-0357](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0357))

Paul Nel discovered that Firefox did not honor certain Cache-Control HTTP directives. A local attacker could exploit this to view private data in improperly cached pages of another user. ([CVE-2009-0358](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0358))
