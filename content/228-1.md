### curl vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04
* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Stefan Esser discovered several buffer overflows in the handling of URLs. By attempting to load an URL with a specially crafted invalid hostname, a local attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application that uses the cURL library.

It is not possible to trick cURL into loading a malicious URL with an HTTP redirect, so this vulnerability was usually not exploitable remotely. However, it could be exploited locally to e. g. circumvent PHP security restrictions.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 5.10
 : libcurl3 
 : libcurl2 

Ubuntu 5.04
 : libcurl3 
 : libcurl2 

Ubuntu 4.10
 : libcurl3 
 : libcurl2 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).
