### OpenJDK vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.10

### Software description

* openjdk-6 

### Details

It was discovered that Java did not correctly handle untrusted applets. If a user were tricked into running a malicious applet, a remote attacker could gain user privileges, or list directory contents. ([CVE-2008-5350](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5347">CVE-2008-5347</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5350))

It was discovered that Kerberos authentication and RSA public key processing were not correctly handled in Java. A remote attacker could exploit these flaws to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-5349](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5348">CVE-2008-5348</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5349))

It was discovered that Java accepted UTF-8 encodings that might be handled incorrectly by certain applications. A remote attacker could bypass string filters, possible leading to other exploits. ([CVE-2008-5351](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5351))

Overflows were discovered in Java JAR processing. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a malicious JAR file, a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-5354](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5352">CVE-2008-5352</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5354))

It was discovered that Java calendar objects were not unserialized safely. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted calendar object, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-5353](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5353))

It was discovered that the Java image handling code could lead to memory corruption. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted image, a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-5359](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5358">CVE-2008-5358</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5359))

It was discovered that temporary files created by Java had predictable names. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted JAR file, a remote attacker could overwrite sensitive information. ([CVE-2008-5360](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5360)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 8.10
 : [openjdk-6-jre-headless](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjdk-6) <span> [6b12-0ubuntu6.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjdk-6/6b12-0ubuntu6.1) </span> 
 : [openjdk-6-jre-lib](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjdk-6) <span> [6b12-0ubuntu6.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjdk-6/6b12-0ubuntu6.1) </span> 
 : [icedtea6-plugin](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjdk-6) <span> [6b12-0ubuntu6.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjdk-6/6b12-0ubuntu6.1) </span> 
 : [openjdk-6-jre](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjdk-6) <span> [6b12-0ubuntu6.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjdk-6/6b12-0ubuntu6.1) </span> 
 : [openjdk-6-jdk](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjdk-6) <span> [6b12-0ubuntu6.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjdk-6/6b12-0ubuntu6.1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart any Java applications to effect the necessary changes.
