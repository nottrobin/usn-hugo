### Details

It was discovered that IcedTea for Java did not properly verify signatures when handling multiply signed or partially signed JAR files, allowing an attacker to cause code to execute that appeared to come from a verified source. ([CVE-2011-0025](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0025))

USN 1052-1 fixed a vulnerability in OpenJDK for Ubuntu 9.10 and Ubuntu 10.04 LTS on all architectures, and Ubuntu 10.10 for all architectures except for the armel (ARM) architecture. This update provides the corresponding update for Ubuntu 10.10 on the armel (ARM) architecture.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that the JNLP SecurityManager in IcedTea for Java OpenJDK in some instances failed to properly apply the intended scurity policy in its checkPermission method. This could allow an attacker to execute code with privileges that should have been prevented. ([CVE-2010-4351](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4351))
