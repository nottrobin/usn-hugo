### Details

It was discovered that APT incorrectly handled the Verify-Host configuration option.

([CVE-2011-3634](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3634))

USN-1215-1 fixed a vulnerability in APT by disabling the apt-key net-update option. This update re-enables the option with corrected verification. Original advisory details: It was discovered that the apt-key utility incorrectly verified GPG keys when downloaded via the net-update option. If a remote attacker were able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could potentially be used to install altered packages.
