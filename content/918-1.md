### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 9.10
 : [samba](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/samba) <span> [2:3.4.0-3ubuntu5.6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/samba/2:3.4.0-3ubuntu5.6) </span> 

Ubuntu 9.04
 : [samba](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/samba) <span> [2:3.3.2-1ubuntu3.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/samba/2:3.3.2-1ubuntu3.4) </span> 

Ubuntu 8.10
 : [samba](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/samba) <span> [2:3.2.3-1ubuntu3.8](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/samba/2:3.2.3-1ubuntu3.8) </span> 

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
 : [samba](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/samba) <span> [3.0.28a-1ubuntu4.11](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/samba/3.0.28a-1ubuntu4.11) </span> 

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : [samba](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/samba) <span> [3.0.22-1ubuntu3.11](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/samba/3.0.22-1ubuntu3.11) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: This update changes the default samba behaviour. For security reasons, it is no longer possible to use wide links and UNIX extensions at the same time. After applying this security update, wide links will be disabled automatically as UNIX extensions are turned on by default. If wide links are required, you can re-enable them by adding &quot;unix extensions = no&quot; to the [global] section of the /etc/samba/smb.conf configuration file.
