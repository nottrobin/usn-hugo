Original advisory details:

 Several dangling pointer vulnerabilities were discovered in Thunderbird. An attacker could exploit this to crash Thunderbird or possibly run arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-3169](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2760">CVE-2010-2760</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2767">CVE-2010-2767</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-3167">CVE-2010-3167</a>) It was discovered that the XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper (SJOW) security wrapper did not always honor the same-origin policy. If JavaScript was enabled, an attacker could exploit this to run untrusted JavaScript from other domains. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2763">CVE-2010-2763</a>) Matt Haggard discovered that Thunderbird did not honor same-origin policy when processing the statusText property of an XMLHttpRequest object. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could use this to gather information about servers on internal private networks. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2764">CVE-2010-2764</a>) Chris Rohlf discovered an integer overflow when Thunderbird processed the HTML frameset element. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could use this to crash Thunderbird or possibly run arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2765">CVE-2010-2765</a>) Several issues were discovered in the browser engine. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could use this to crash Thunderbird or possibly run arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2766">CVE-2010-2766</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-3168">CVE-2010-3168</a>) David Huang and Collin Jackson discovered that the &lt;object&gt; tag could override the charset of a framed HTML document in another origin. An attacker could utilize this to perform cross-site scripting attacks. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2768">CVE-2010-2768</a>) Paul Stone discovered that with designMode enabled an HTML selection containing JavaScript could be copied and pasted into a document and have the JavaScript execute within the context of the site where the code was dropped. If JavaScript was enabled, an attacker could utilize this to perform cross-site scripting attacks. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2769">CVE-2010-2769</a>) A buffer overflow was discovered in Thunderbird when processing text runs. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could use this to crash Thunderbird or possibly run arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-3166">CVE-2010-3166</a>) Peter Van der Beken, Jason Oster, Jesse Ruderman, Igor Bukanov, Jeff Walden, Gary Kwong and Olli Pettay discovered several flaws in the browser engine. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could use this to crash Thunderbird or possibly run arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.
