### libgd2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Several buffer overflows have been discovered in libgd&#39;s PNG handling functions.

If an attacker tricked a user into loading a malicious PNG image, they could leverage this into executing arbitrary code in the context of the user opening image. Most importantly, this library is commonly used in PHP. One possible target would be a PHP driven photo website that lets users upload images. Therefore this vulnerability might lead to privilege escalation to a web server&#39;s privileges.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 4.10
 : libgd2-xpm 
 : libgd2-noxpm 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

None
