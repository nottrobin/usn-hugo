### perl vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04
* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

USN-222-1 fixed a vulnerability in the Perl interpreter. It was discovered that the version of USN-222-1 was not sufficient to handle all possible cases of malformed input that could lead to arbitrary code execution, so another update is necessary.

Original advisory:

 Jack Louis of Dyad Security discovered that Perl did not sufficiently check the explicit length argument in format strings. Specially crafted format strings with overly large length arguments led to a crash of the Perl interpreter or even to execution of arbitrary attacker-defined code with the privileges of the user running the Perl program.

 However, this attack was only possible in insecure Perl programs which use variables with user-defined values in string interpolations without checking their validity.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 5.10
 : perl-base 
 : libperl5.8 

Ubuntu 5.04
 : perl-base 
 : libperl5.8 

Ubuntu 4.10
 : perl-base 
 : libperl5.8 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).
