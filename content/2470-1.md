    Matt Mackall and Augie Fackler discovered that Git incorrectly handled certain filesystem paths. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code if the Git tree is stored in an HFS+ or NTFS filesystem. The remote attacker would need write access to a Git repository that the victim pulls from.

### git vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.10
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Git could be made to run programs as your login if it received specially crafted changes from a remote repository.

### Software description

* git 

### Details

Matt Mackall and Augie Fackler discovered that Git incorrectly handled certain filesystem paths. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to execute arbitrary code if the Git tree is stored in an HFS+ or NTFS filesystem. The remote attacker would need write access to a Git repository that the victim pulls from. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 14.10
 : [git](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/git) <span> [1:2.1.0-1ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/git/1:2.1.0-1ubuntu0.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 : [git](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/git) <span> [1:1.9.1-1ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/git/1:1.9.1-1ubuntu0.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [git](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/git) <span> [1:1.7.9.5-1ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/git/1:1.7.9.5-1ubuntu0.1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to set the core.protectHFS and/or core.protectNTFS Git configuration variables to &quot;true&quot; if you store Git trees in HFS+ and/or NTFS filesystems. If you host Git trees, setting the core.protectHFS, core.protectNTFS, and receive.fsckObjects Git configuration variables to &quot;true&quot; will cause your Git server to reject objects containing malicious paths intended to overwrite the Git metadata.
