    Piotr Engelking discovered that strxfrm in Python was not correctly calculating the size of the destination buffer.  This could lead to small information leaks, which might be used by attackers to gain additional knowledge about the state of a running Python script.

### python2.4/2.5 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 7.10
* Ubuntu 7.04
* Ubuntu 6.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* python2.4 

* python2.5 

### Details

Piotr Engelking discovered that strxfrm in Python was not correctly calculating the size of the destination buffer. This could lead to small information leaks, which might be used by attackers to gain additional knowledge about the state of a running Python script. ([CVE-2007-2052](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2052))

A flaw was discovered in the Python imageop module. If a script using the module could be tricked into processing a specially crafted set of arguments, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code, or cause the application to crash. ([CVE-2007-4965](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-4965))
