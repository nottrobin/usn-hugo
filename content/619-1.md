### firefox vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 7.10
* Ubuntu 7.04
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* firefox 

### Details

Various flaws were discovered in the browser engine. By tricking a user into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-2799](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2798">CVE-2008-2798</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2799))

Several problems were discovered in the JavaScript engine. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could perform cross-site scripting attacks. ([CVE-2008-2800](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2800))

Collin Jackson discovered various flaws in the JavaScript engine which allowed JavaScript to be injected into signed JAR files. If a user were tricked into opening malicious web content, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a different website or link content within the JAR file to an attacker-controlled JavaScript file. ([CVE-2008-2801](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2801))

It was discovered that Firefox would allow non-privileged XUL documents to load chrome scripts from the fastload file. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code with chrome privileges. ([CVE-2008-2802](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2802))

A flaw was discovered in Firefox that allowed overwriting trusted objects via mozIJSSubScriptLoader.loadSubScript(). If a user were tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-2803](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2803))

Claudio Santambrogio discovered a vulnerability in Firefox which could lead to stealing of arbitrary files. If a user were tricked into opening malicious content, an attacker could force the browser into uploading local files to the remote server. ([CVE-2008-2805](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2805))

Gregory Fleischer discovered a flaw in Java LiveConnect. An attacker could exploit this to bypass the same-origin policy and create arbitrary socket connections to other domains. ([CVE-2008-2806](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2806))

Daniel Glazman found that an improperly encoded .properties file in an add-on can result in uninitialized memory being used. If a user were tricked into installing a malicious add-on, the browser may be able to see data from other programs. ([CVE-2008-2807](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2807))

Masahiro Yamada discovered that Firefox did not properly sanitize file URLs in directory listings, resulting in files from directory listings being opened in unintended ways or not being able to be opened by the browser at all. ([CVE-2008-2808](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2808))

John G. Myers discovered a weakness in the trust model used by Firefox regarding alternate names on self-signed certificates. If a user were tricked into accepting a certificate containing alternate name entries, an attacker could impersonate another server. ([CVE-2008-2809](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2809))

A flaw was discovered in the way Firefox opened URL files. If a user were tricked into opening a bookmark to a malicious web page, the page could potentially read from local files on the user&#39;s computer. ([CVE-2008-2810](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2810))

A vulnerability was discovered in the block reflow code of Firefox. This vulnerability could be used by an attacker to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-2811](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2811)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:
