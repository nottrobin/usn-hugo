This vulnerability is not exposed when running gpg in batch mode. ([CVE-2006-6169](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-6169))

 Tavis Ormandy discovered that gnupg was incorrectly using the stack. If a user were tricked into processing a specially crafted message, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2006-6235](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-6235))
