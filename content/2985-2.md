### eglibc, glibc regression

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 15.10
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

USN-2985-1 introduced a regression in the GNU C Library. 

### Software description

* eglibc 

* glibc 

### Details

USN-2985-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the GNU C Library. The fix for [CVE-2014-9761](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-9761">CVE-2014-9761</a> introduced a regression which affected applications that use the libm library but were not fully restarted after the upgrade. This update removes the fix for <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-9761) and a future update will be provided to address this issue.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Martin Carpenter discovered that pt_chown in the GNU C Library did not properly check permissions for tty files. A local attacker could use this to gain administrative privileges or expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-3075](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2207">CVE-2013-2207</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2856">CVE-2016-2856</a>) Robin Hack discovered that the Name Service Switch (NSS) implementation in the GNU C Library did not properly manage its file descriptors. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (infinite loop). (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8121">CVE-2014-8121</a>) Joseph Myers discovered that the GNU C Library did not properly handle long arguments to functions returning a representation of Not a Number (NaN). An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (stack exhaustion leading to an application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-9761">CVE-2014-9761</a>) Arjun Shankar discovered that in certain situations the nss_dns code in the GNU C Library did not properly account buffer sizes when passed an unaligned buffer. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1781">CVE-2015-1781</a>) Sumit Bose and Lukas Slebodnik discovered that the Name Service Switch (NSS) implementation in the GNU C Library did not handle long lines in the files databases correctly. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-5277">CVE-2015-5277</a>) Adam Nielsen discovered that the strftime function in the GNU C Library did not properly handle out-of-range argument data. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8776">CVE-2015-8776</a>) Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll discovered that the GNU C Library allowed the pointer-guarding protection mechanism to be disabled by honoring the LD_POINTER_GUARD environment variable across privilege boundaries. A local attacker could use this to exploit an existing vulnerability more easily. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8777">CVE-2015-8777</a>) Szabolcs Nagy discovered that the hcreate functions in the GNU C Library did not properly check its size argument, leading to an integer overflow. An attacker could use to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8778">CVE-2015-8778</a>) Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the catopen function in the GNU C Library when handling long catalog names. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8779">CVE-2015-8779</a>) Florian Weimer discovered that the getnetbyname implementation in the GNU C Library did not properly handle long names passed as arguments. An attacker could use to cause a denial of service (stack exhaustion leading to an application crash). (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-3075))
