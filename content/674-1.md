description: |
    It was discovered that the hpssd tool of hplip did not validate privileges in the alert-mailing function. A local attacker could exploit this to gain privileges and send e-mail messages from the account of the hplip user. This update alters hplip behaviour by preventing users from setting alerts and by moving alert configuration to a root-controlled /etc/hp/alerts.conf file.
