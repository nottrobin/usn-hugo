* Ubuntu 13.04
* Ubuntu 12.10
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

### Software description

* graphviz 

### Details

It was discovered that Graphviz incorrectly handled memory in the yyerror function. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted dot file, an attacker could cause Graphviz to crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-1235](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-0978">CVE-2014-0978</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1235))

It was discovered that Graphviz incorrectly handled memory in the chkNum function. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted dot file, an attacker could cause Graphviz to crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-1236](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1236))

The default compiler options for affected releases should reduce the vulnerability to a denial of service.
