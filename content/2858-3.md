### linux-raspi2 vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 15.10

### Summary

The system could be made to run programs as an administrator. 

### Software description

* linux-raspi2 

### Details

Nathan Williams discovered that overlayfs in the Linux kernel incorrectly handled setattr operations. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to create files with administrative permission attributes and execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 15.10
 : [linux-image-4.2.0-1018-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-raspi2) <span> [4.2.0-1018.25](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-raspi2/4.2.0-1018.25) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
