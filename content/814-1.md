### openjdk-6 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 9.04
* Ubuntu 8.10

### Software description

* openjdk-6 

### Details

It was discovered that the XML HMAC signature system did not correctly check certain lengths. If an attacker sent a truncated HMAC, it could bypass authentication, leading to potential privilege escalation. ([CVE-2009-0217](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0217))

It was discovered that JAR bundles would appear signed if only one element was signed. If a user were tricked into running a malicious Java applet, a remote attacker could exploit this to gain access to private information and potentially run untrusted code. ([CVE-2009-1896](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1896))

It was discovered that certain variables could leak information. If a user were tricked into running a malicious Java applet, a remote attacker could exploit this to gain access to private information and potentially run untrusted code. ([CVE-2009-2690](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-2475">CVE-2009-2475</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-2690))

A flaw was discovered the OpenType checking. If a user were tricked into running a malicious Java applet, a remote attacker could bypass access restrictions. ([CVE-2009-2476](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-2476))

It was discovered that the XML processor did not correctly check recursion. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted XML, the system could crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-2625](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-2625))

It was discovered that the Java audio subsystem did not correctly validate certain parameters. If a user were tricked into running an untrusted applet, a remote attacker could read system properties. ([CVE-2009-2670](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-2670))

Multiple flaws were discovered in the proxy subsystem. If a user were tricked into running an untrusted applet, a remote attacker could discover local user names, obtain access to sensitive information, or bypass socket restrictions, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2009-2673](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-2671">CVE-2009-2671</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-2672">CVE-2009-2672</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-2673))

Flaws were discovered in the handling of JPEG images, Unpack200 archives, and JDK13Services. If a user were tricked into running an untrusted applet, a remote attacker could load a specially crafted file that would bypass local file access protections and run arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2009-2689](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-2674">CVE-2009-2674</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-2675">CVE-2009-2675</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-2676">CVE-2009-2676</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-2689)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:
