Original advisory details:

 Christoph Diehl, Christian Holler, Mats Palmgren, Chiaki Ishikawa, Bill Gianopoulos, Benoit Jacob, Gary Kwong, Robert O&#39;Callahan, Jesse Ruderman, and Julian Seward discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-0743](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0769">CVE-2013-0769</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0749">CVE-2013-0749</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0770">CVE-2013-0770</a>) Abhishek Arya discovered several user-after-free and buffer overflows in Firefox. An attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
