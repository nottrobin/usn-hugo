### Details

Christian Holler, David Major, Jesse Ruderman, Tyson Smith, Boris Zbarsky, Randell Jesup, Olli Pettay, Karl Tomlinson, Jeff Walden, and Gary Kwong discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2015-4513](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-4513))

Tyson Smith and David Keeler discovered a use-after-poison and buffer overflow in NSS. An attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2015-7182](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7181">CVE-2015-7181</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7182))

Ryan Sleevi discovered an integer overflow in NSPR. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2015-7183](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7183))

MichaÅ‚ Bentkowski discovered that adding white-space to hostnames that are IP addresses can bypass same-origin protections. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browser-like context, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2015-7188](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7188))

Looben Yang discovered a buffer overflow during script interactions with the canvas element in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browser-like context, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2015-7189](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7189))

Shinto K Anto discovered that CORS preflight is bypassed when receiving non-standard Content-Type headers in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browser-like context, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions. ([CVE-2015-7193](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7193))

Gustavo Grieco discovered a buffer overflow in libjar in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browser-like context, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2015-7194](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7194))

Ehsan Akhgari discovered a mechanism for a web worker to bypass secure requirements for web sockets. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browser-like context, an attacker could exploit this to bypass the mixed content web socket policy. ([CVE-2015-7197](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7197))

Ronald Crane discovered several vulnerabilities through code-inspection. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browser-like context, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2015-7200](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7198">CVE-2015-7198</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7199">CVE-2015-7199</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7200))
