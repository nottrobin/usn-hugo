    It was discovered that OpenSSL could be made to dereference a NULL pointer when processing S/MIME messages. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. These issues did not affect Ubuntu 8.04 LTS.

### openssl vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.10
* Ubuntu 11.04
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Summary

An application using OpenSSL could be made to crash or run programs if it opened a specially crafted file.

### Software description

* openssl 

### Details

It was discovered that OpenSSL could be made to dereference a NULL pointer when processing S/MIME messages. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. These issues did not affect Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2012-1165](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-7250">CVE-2006-7250</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1165))

Tavis Ormandy discovered that OpenSSL did not properly perform bounds checking when processing DER data via BIO or FILE functions. A remote attacker could trigger this flaw in services that used SSL to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with application privileges. ([CVE-2012-2110](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2110))
