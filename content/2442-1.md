    An information leak in the Linux kernel was discovered that could leak the high 16 bits of the kernel stack address on 32-bit Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) paravirt guests. A user in the guest OS could exploit this leak to obtain information that could potentially be used to aid in attacking the kernel.

### linux-ec2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ec2 

### Details

An information leak in the Linux kernel was discovered that could leak the high 16 bits of the kernel stack address on 32-bit Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) paravirt guests. A user in the guest OS could exploit this leak to obtain information that could potentially be used to aid in attacking the kernel. ([CVE-2014-8134](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8134))

A flaw in the handling of malformed ASCONF chunks by SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel was discovered. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2014-3673](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3673))

A flaw in the handling of duplicate ASCONF chunks by SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel was discovered. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (panic). ([CVE-2014-3687](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3687))

It was discovered that excessive queuing by SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) implementation in the Linux kernel can cause memory pressure. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2014-3688](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3688))

A null pointer dereference flaw was discovered in the the Linux kernel&#39;s SCTP implementation when ASCONF is used. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) via a malformed INIT chunk. ([CVE-2014-7841](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-7841))

Jouni Malinen reported a flaw in the handling of fragmentation in the mac8Linux subsystem of the kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain potential sensitive cleartext information by reading packets. ([CVE-2014-8709](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8709))

A stack buffer overflow was discovered in the ioctl command handling for the Technotrend/Hauppauge USB DEC devices driver. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2014-8884](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8884))

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle faults associated with the Stack Segment (SS) register on the x86 architecture. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (panic). ([CVE-2014-9090](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-9090)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-2.6.32-374-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2) <span> [2.6.32-374.91](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2/2.6.32-374.91) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
