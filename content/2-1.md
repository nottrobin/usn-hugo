    Chris Evans discovered several integer overflow vulnerabilities in xpdf, a viewer for PDF files.  The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) also uses the same code to print PDF files.  In either case, these vulnerabilities could be exploited by an attacker by providing a specially crafted PDF file which, when processed by CUPS or xpdf, could result in abnormal program termination or the execution of program code supplied by the attacker.

### xpdf vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Chris Evans discovered several integer overflow vulnerabilities in xpdf, a viewer for PDF files. The Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) also uses the same code to print PDF files. In either case, these vulnerabilities could be exploited by an attacker by providing a specially crafted PDF file which, when processed by CUPS or xpdf, could result in abnormal program termination or the execution of program code supplied by the attacker.

In the case of CUPS, this bug could be exploited to gain the privileges of the CUPS print server (by default, user cupsys).

In the case of xpdf, this bug could be exploited to gain the privileges of the user invoking xpdf.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 4.10
 : xpdf-utils 
 : xpdf-reader 
 : cupsys 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).
