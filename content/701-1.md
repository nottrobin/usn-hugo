### thunderbird vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 7.10

### Software description

* thunderbird 

### Details

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine. If a user had Javascript enabled, these problems could allow an attacker to crash Thunderbird and possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-5500](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5500))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that the same-origin check in Thunderbird could be bypassed by utilizing XBL-bindings. If a user had Javascript enabled, an attacker could exploit this to read data from other domains. ([CVE-2008-5503](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5503))

Marius Schilder discovered that Thunderbird did not properly handle redirects to an outside domain when an XMLHttpRequest was made to a same-origin resource. When Javascript is enabled, it&#39;s possible that sensitive information could be revealed in the XMLHttpRequest response. ([CVE-2008-5506](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5506))

Chris Evans discovered that Thunderbird did not properly protect a user&#39;s data when accessing a same-domain Javascript URL that is redirected to an unparsable Javascript off-site resource. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website and had Javascript enabled, an attacker may be able to steal a limited amount of private data. ([CVE-2008-5507](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5507))

Chip Salzenberg, Justin Schuh, Tom Cross, and Peter William discovered Thunderbird did not properly parse URLs when processing certain control characters. ([CVE-2008-5508](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5508))

Kojima Hajime discovered that Thunderbird did not properly handle an escaped null character. An attacker may be able to exploit this flaw to bypass script sanitization. ([CVE-2008-5510](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5510))

Several flaws were discovered in the Javascript engine. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website and had Javascript enabled, an attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary Javascript code within the context of another website or with chrome privileges. ([CVE-2008-5512](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5511">CVE-2008-5511</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5512))
