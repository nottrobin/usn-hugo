### oxide-qt vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 15.04
* Ubuntu 14.10
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Oxide. 

### Software description

* oxide-qt 

### Details

Several security issues were discovered in the DOM implementation in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to bypass Same Origin Policy restrictions. ([CVE-2015-1254](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1253">CVE-2015-1253</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1254))

A use-after-free was discovered in the WebAudio implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1255](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1255))

A use-after-free was discovered in the SVG implementation in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1256](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1256))

A security issue was discovered in the SVG implementation in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash. ([CVE-2015-1257](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1257))

An issue was discovered with the build of libvpx. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1258](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1258))

Multiple use-after-free issues were discovered in the WebRTC implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1260](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1260))

An uninitialized value bug was discovered in the font shaping code in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash. ([CVE-2015-1262](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1262))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1265](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1265))

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-3910](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-3910))
