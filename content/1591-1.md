    Alec Warner discovered that xdiagnose improperly handled temporary files in welcome.py when creating user-initiated archive files. While failsafeX does not use the vulnerable code, this update removes this functionality to protect any 3rd party applications which import the vulnerable code. In the default Ubuntu installation, this should be prevented by the Yama link restrictions.
