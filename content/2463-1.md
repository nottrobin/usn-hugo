### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

A race condition with MMIO and PIO transactions in the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem of the Linux kernel was discovered. A guest OS user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) via a specially crafted application. ([CVE-2014-7842](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-7842))

The KVM (kernel virtual machine) subsystem of the Linux kernel miscalculates the number of memory pages during the handling of a mapping failure. A guest OS user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (host OS page unpinning) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging guest OS privileges. ([CVE-2014-8369](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8369)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-75-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-75.110](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-75.110) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-75-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-75.110](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-75.110) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-75-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-75.110](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-75.110) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-75-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-75.110](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-75.110) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-75-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-75.110](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-75.110) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-75-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-75.110](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-75.110) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-75-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-75.110](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-75.110) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
