### linux-lts-backport-oneiric vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-backport-oneiric 

### Details

Clement Lecigne discovered a bug in the HFS filesystem. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a kernel oops. ([CVE-2011-2203](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2203))

A bug was discovered in the XFS filesystem&#39;s handling of pathnames. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service, or gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-4077](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4077))

A flaw was found in how the Linux kernel handles user-defined key types. An unprivileged local user could exploit this to crash the system. ([CVE-2011-4110](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4110))

A flaw was found in the Journaling Block Device (JBD). A local attacker able to mount ext3 or ext4 file systems could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-4132](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4132))

Clement Lecigne discovered a bug in the HFS file system bounds checking. When a malformed HFS file system is mounted a local user could crash the system or gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-4330](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4330))

Chen Haogang discovered an integer overflow that could result in memory corruption. A local unprivileged user could use this to crash the system. ([CVE-2012-0044](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0044)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-15-server](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric) <span> [3.0.0-15.25~lucid1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric/3.0.0-15.25~lucid1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-15-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric) <span> [3.0.0-15.25~lucid1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric/3.0.0-15.25~lucid1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-15-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric) <span> [3.0.0-15.25~lucid1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric/3.0.0-15.25~lucid1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-15-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric) <span> [3.0.0-15.25~lucid1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric/3.0.0-15.25~lucid1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
