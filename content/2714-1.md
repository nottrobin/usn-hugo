    Marcelo Ricardo Leitner discovered a race condition in the Linux kernel&#39;s SCTP address configuration lists when using Address Configuration Change (ASCONF) options on a socket. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-3212](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-3212))

### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

Marcelo Ricardo Leitner discovered a race condition in the Linux kernel&#39;s SCTP address configuration lists when using Address Configuration Change (ASCONF) options on a socket. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-3212](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-3212))

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service using a flood of UDP packets with invalid checksums. ([CVE-2015-5364](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-5364))

A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles invalid UDP checksums. A remote attacker can cause a denial of service against applications that use epoll by injecting a single packet with an invalid checksum. ([CVE-2015-5366](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-5366)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-1469-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [3.2.0-1469.90](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1469.90) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
