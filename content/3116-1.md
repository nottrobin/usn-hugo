### Details

It was discovered that DBus incorrectly validated the source of ActivationFailure signals. A local attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2015-0245](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0245))

It was discovered that DBus incorrectly handled certain format strings. A local attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue is only exposed to unprivileged users when the fix for [CVE-2015-0245](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-0245) is not applied, hence this issue is only likely to affect Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.10 have been updated as a preventative measure in the event that a new attack vector for this issue is discovered. (No CVE number)
