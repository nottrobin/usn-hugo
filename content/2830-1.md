    Guy Leaver discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled a ServerKeyExchange for an anonymous DH ciphersuite with the value of p set to 0. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 15.10.

### Details

Guy Leaver discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled a ServerKeyExchange for an anonymous DH ciphersuite with the value of p set to 0. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 15.10. ([CVE-2015-1794](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1794))

Hanno Böck discovered that the OpenSSL Montgomery squaring procedure algorithm may produce incorrect results when being used on x86_64. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to break encryption. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 15.10. ([CVE-2015-3193](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-3193))

Loïc Jonas Etienne discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled ASN.1 signatures with a missing PSS parameter. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-3194](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-3194))

Adam Langley discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled malformed X509_ATTRIBUTE structures. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-3195](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-3195))

It was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled PSK identity hints. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 15.04. ([CVE-2015-3196](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-3196))
