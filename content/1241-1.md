### linux-fsl-imx51 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-fsl-imx51 

### Details

 It was discovered that the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) implementation incorrectly calculated lengths. If the net.sctp.addip_enable variable was turned on, a remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic to crash the system. ([CVE-2011-1573](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1573))

Ryan Sweat discovered that the kernel incorrectly handled certain VLAN packets. On some systems, a remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1576](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1576))

Timo Warns discovered that the EFI GUID partition table was not correctly parsed. A physically local attacker that could insert mountable devices could exploit this to crash the system or possibly gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-1776](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1776))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the IPv4 diagnostic routines did not correctly validate certain requests. A local attacker could exploit this to consume CPU resources, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2213](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2213))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that taskstats did not enforce access restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain information, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2011-2494](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2494))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that /proc/PID/io did not enforce access restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain information, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2011-2495](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2495))

Robert Swiecki discovered that mapping extensions were incorrectly handled. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2496](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2496))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the Bluetooth stack incorrectly handled certain L2CAP requests. If a system was using Bluetooth, a remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic to crash the system or gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-2497](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2497))

It was discovered that the wireless stack incorrectly verified SSID lengths. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service or gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-2517](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2517))

Ben Pfaff discovered that Classless Queuing Disciplines (qdiscs) were being incorrectly handled. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2525](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2525))

It was discovered that the EXT4 filesystem contained multiple off-by-one flaws. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2695](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2695))

Herbert Xu discovered that certain fields were incorrectly handled when Generic Receive Offload ([CVE-2011-2723](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2723))

Christian Ohm discovered that the perf command looks for configuration files in the current directory. If a privileged user were tricked into running perf in a directory containing a malicious configuration file, an attacker could run arbitrary commands and possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2011-2905](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2905))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Comedi driver did not correctly clear memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2011-2909](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2909))

Time Warns discovered that long symlinks were incorrectly handled on Be filesystems. A local attacker could exploit this with a malformed Be filesystem and crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2928](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2928))

Dan Kaminsky discovered that the kernel incorrectly handled random sequence number generation. An attacker could use this flaw to possibly predict sequence numbers and inject packets. ([CVE-2011-3188](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3188))

Darren Lavender discovered that the CIFS client incorrectly handled certain large values. A remote attacker with a malicious server could exploit this to crash the system or possibly execute arbitrary code as the root user. ([CVE-2011-3191](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3191))

Yogesh Sharma discovered that CIFS did not correctly handle UNCs that had no prefixpaths. A local attacker with access to a CIFS partition could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-3363](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3363))

Gideon Naim discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s handling VLAN 0 frames. An attacker on the local network could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-3593](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3593)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-2.6.31-611-imx51](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-fsl-imx51) <span> [2.6.31-611.29](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-fsl-imx51/2.6.31-611.29) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
