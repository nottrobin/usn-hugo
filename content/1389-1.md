### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

 Paolo Bonzini discovered a flaw in Linux&#39;s handling of the SG_IO ioctl command. A local user, or user in a VM could exploit this flaw to bypass restrictions and gain read/write access to all data on the affected block device. ([CVE-2011-4127](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4127))

A flaw was found in KVM&#39;s Programmable Interval Timer (PIT). When a virtual interrupt control is not available a local user could use this to cause a denial of service by starting a timer. ([CVE-2011-4622](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4622))

A flaw was discovered in the XFS filesystem. If a local user mounts a specially crafted XFS image it could potential execute arbitrary code on the system. ([CVE-2012-0038](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0038))

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel&#39;s ext4 file system when mounting a corrupt filesystem. A user-assisted remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-2100](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2100)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
