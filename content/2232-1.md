    Jüri Aedla discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled invalid DTLS fragments. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 13.10, and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-0195](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-0195))
