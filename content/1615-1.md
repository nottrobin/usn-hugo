### python3.2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.10
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 11.10
* Ubuntu 11.04

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Python 3.2. 

### Software description

* python3.2 

### Details

It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2011-4944](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4944))

It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04 and 11.10. ([CVE-2012-0845](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0845))

It was discovered that Python was susceptible to hash algorithm attacks. An attacker could cause a denial of service under certian circumstances. This update adds the &#39;-R&#39; command line option and honors setting the PYTHONHASHSEED environment variable to &#39;random&#39; to salt str and datetime objects with an unpredictable value. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04 and 11.10. ([CVE-2012-1150](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1150))

Serhiy Storchaka discovered that the UTF16 decoder in Python did not properly reset internal variables after error handling. An attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via memory corruption. This issue did not affect Ubuntu 12.10. ([CVE-2012-2135](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2135))
