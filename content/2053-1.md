    Ben Turner, Bobby Holley, Jesse Ruderman and Christian Holler discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.

### thunderbird vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 13.10
* Ubuntu 13.04
* Ubuntu 12.10
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird. 

### Software description

* thunderbird 

### Details

Ben Turner, Bobby Holley, Jesse Ruderman and Christian Holler discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-5609](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5609))

Tyson Smith and Jesse Schwartzentruber discovered a use-after-free in event listeners. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-5616](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5616))

A use-after-free was discovered in the table editing interface. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-5618](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5618))

Tyson Smith and Jesse Schwartzentruber discovered a crash when inserting an ordered list in to a document using script. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-6671](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-6671))

Sijie Xia discovered that trust settings for built-in EV root certificates were ignored under certain circumstances, removing the ability for a user to manually untrust certificates from specific authorities. ([CVE-2013-6673](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-6673))

Tyson Smith, Jesse Schwartzentruber and Atte Kettunen discovered a use-after-free in functions for synthetic mouse movement handling. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-5613](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5613))

Eric Faust discovered that GetElementIC typed array stubs can be generated outside observed typesets. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could possibly exploit this to cause undefined behaviour with a potential security impact. ([CVE-2013-5615](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5615))

Michal Zalewski discovered several issues with JPEG image handling. An attacker could potentially exploit these to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-6630](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-6629">CVE-2013-6629</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-6630))
