description: |
    An information leak was discovered in the handling of ICMPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) messages in the Linux kernel&#39;s IPv6 network stack. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (excessive retries and address-generation outage), and consequently obtain sensitive information.

### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.10

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

An information leak was discovered in the handling of ICMPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) messages in the Linux kernel&#39;s IPv6 network stack. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (excessive retries and address-generation outage), and consequently obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-0343](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0343))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of the Linux kernel. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (heap memory corruption) via a specially crafted device that provides an invalid Report ID. ([CVE-2013-2888](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2888))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem when CONFIG_HID_ZEROPLUS is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2889](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2889))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of the Linux kerenl when CONFIG_HID_PANTHERLORD is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (heap out-of-bounds write) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2892](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2892))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of the Linux kernel when any of CONFIG_LOGITECH_FF, CONFIG_LOGIG940_FF, or CONFIG_LOGIWHEELS_FF are enabled. A physcially proximate attacker can leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service vias a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2893](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2893))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG_HID_LOGITECH_DJ is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (OOPS) or obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2895](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2895))

Kees Cook discovered a vulnerability in the Linux Kernel&#39;s Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem&#39;s support for N-Trig touch screens. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2896](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2896))

Kees Cook discovered yet another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG_HID_MULTITOUCH is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2897](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2897))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of the Linux kernel whe CONFIG_HID_PICOLCD is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2899](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2899))

Alan Chester reported a flaw in the IPv6 Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) of the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information by sniffing network traffic. ([CVE-2013-4350](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4350))

Dmitry Vyukov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s handling of IPv6 UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO) processing. A remote attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4387](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4387)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.10
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-235-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [3.5.0-235.51](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-235.51) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
