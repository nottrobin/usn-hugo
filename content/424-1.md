### php5 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
* Ubuntu 5.10

### Details

Multiple buffer overflows have been discovered in various PHP modules. If a PHP application processes untrusted data with functions of the session or zip module, or various string functions, a remote attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server. ([CVE-2007-0906](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0906))

The sapi_header_op() function had a buffer underflow that could be exploited to crash the PHP interpreter. ([CVE-2007-0907](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0907))

The wddx unserialization handler did not correctly check for some buffer boundaries and had an uninitialized variable. By unserializing untrusted data, this could be exploited to expose memory regions that were not meant to be accessible. Depending on the PHP application this could lead to disclosure of potentially sensitive information. ([CVE-2007-0908](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0908))

On 64 bit systems (the amd64 and sparc platforms), various print functions and the odbc_result_all() were susceptible to a format string vulnerability. A remote attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server. ([CVE-2007-0909](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0909))

Under certain circumstances it was possible to overwrite superglobal variables (like the HTTP GET/POST arrays) with crafted session data. ([CVE-2007-0910](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0910))

When unserializing untrusted data on 64-bit platforms the zend_hash_init() function could be forced to enter an infinite loop, consuming CPU resources, for a limited length of time, until the script timeout alarm aborts the script. ([CVE-2007-0988](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0988))

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 6.10
 : php5-cli <span>5.1.6-1ubuntu2.2</span>
 : php5-cgi <span>5.1.6-1ubuntu2.2</span>
 : libapache2-mod-php5 <span>5.1.6-1ubuntu2.2</span>
 : php5-common <span>5.1.6-1ubuntu2.2</span>
 : php5-odbc <span>5.1.6-1ubuntu2.2</span>

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : php5-cli <span>5.1.2-1ubuntu3.5</span>
 : php5-cgi <span>5.1.2-1ubuntu3.5</span>
 : libapache2-mod-php5 <span>5.1.2-1ubuntu3.5</span>
 : php5-common <span>5.1.2-1ubuntu3.5</span>
 : php5-odbc <span>5.1.2-1ubuntu3.5</span>

Ubuntu 5.10
 : php5-cli <span>5.0.5-2ubuntu1.7</span>
 : php5-cgi <span>5.0.5-2ubuntu1.7</span>
 : libapache2-mod-php5 <span>5.0.5-2ubuntu1.7</span>
 : php5-common <span>5.0.5-2ubuntu1.7</span>
 : php5-odbc <span>5.0.5-2ubuntu1.7</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Apache or reboot your computer to effect the necessary changes.
