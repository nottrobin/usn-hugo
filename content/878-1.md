### Details

USN-874-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox and Xulrunner. The upstream changes introduced a regression when using NTLM authentication. This update fixes the problem and adds additional stability fixes.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details: Jesse Ruderman, Josh Soref, Martijn Wargers, Jose Angel, Olli Pettay, and David James discovered several flaws in the browser and JavaScript engines of Firefox. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-3986](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3979">CVE-2009-3979</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3980">CVE-2009-3980</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3982">CVE-2009-3982</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3986))

 Takehiro Takahashi discovered flaws in the NTLM implementation in Firefox. If an NTLM authenticated user visited a malicious website, a remote attacker could send requests to other applications, authenticated as the user. ([CVE-2009-3983](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3983))

 Jonathan Morgan discovered that Firefox did not properly display SSL indicators under certain circumstances. This could be used by an attacker to spoof an encrypted page, such as in a phishing attack. ([CVE-2009-3984](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3984))

 Jordi Chancel discovered that Firefox did not properly display invalid URLs for a blank page. If a user were tricked into accessing a malicious website, an attacker could exploit this to spoof the location bar, such as in a phishing attack. ([CVE-2009-3985](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3985))

 David Keeler, Bob Clary, and Dan Kaminsky discovered several flaws in third party media libraries. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted media file, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-3389](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3388">CVE-2009-3388</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3389))
