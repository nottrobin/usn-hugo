description: |
    It was discovered that PHP, when used as a stand alone CGI processor for the Apache Web Server, did not properly parse and filter query strings. This could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code running with the privilege of the web server. Configurations using mod_php5 and FastCGI were not vulnerable.

### php5 vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 11.10
* Ubuntu 11.04
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Summary

Standalone PHP CGI scripts could be made to execute arbitrary code with the privilege of the web server.

### Software description

* php5 

### Details

It was discovered that PHP, when used as a stand alone CGI processor for the Apache Web Server, did not properly parse and filter query strings. This could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code running with the privilege of the web server. Configurations using mod_php5 and FastCGI were not vulnerable.

This update addresses the issue when the PHP CGI interpreter is configured using mod_cgi and mod_actions as described in /usr/share/doc/php5-cgi/README.Debian.gz; however, if an alternate configuration is used to enable PHP CGI processing, it should be reviewed to ensure that command line arguments cannot be passed to the PHP interpreter. Please see [CVE-2012-2311](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2311) for more details and potential mitigation approaches.
