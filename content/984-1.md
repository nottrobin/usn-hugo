### lftp vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 9.10
* Ubuntu 9.04
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Software description

* lftp 

### Details

It was discovered that LFTP incorrectly filtered filenames suggested by Content-Disposition headers. If a user or automated system were tricked into downloading a file from a malicious site, a remote attacker could create the file with an arbitrary name, such as a dotfile, and possibly run arbitrary code. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [lftp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lftp) <span> [4.0.2-1ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lftp/4.0.2-1ubuntu0.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 9.10
 : [lftp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lftp) <span> [3.7.15-1ubuntu2.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lftp/3.7.15-1ubuntu2.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 9.04
 : [lftp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lftp) <span> [3.7.8-1ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lftp/3.7.8-1ubuntu0.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
 : [lftp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lftp) <span> [3.6.1-1ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lftp/3.6.1-1ubuntu0.1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: This update changes previous behaviour by ignoring the filename supplied by servers in Content-Disposition headers. To re-enable previous behaviour, use the new xfer:auto-rename setting.
