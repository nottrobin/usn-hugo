### devhelp, epiphany-browser, midbrowser, yelp update

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Software description

* devhelp 

* epiphany-browser 

* midbrowser 

* yelp 

### Details

USN-626-1 fixed vulnerabilities in xulrunner-1.9. The changes required that Devhelp, Epiphany, Midbrowser and Yelp also be updated to use the new xulrunner-1.9.

Original advisory details:

 A flaw was discovered in the browser engine. A variable could be made to overflow causing the browser to crash. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-2933](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2785">CVE-2008-2785</a>) Billy Rios discovered that Firefox and xulrunner, as used by browsers such as Epiphany, did not properly perform URI splitting with pipe symbols when passed a command-line URI. If Firefox or xulrunner were passed a malicious URL, an attacker may be able to execute local content with chrome privileges. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2933))
