description: |
    Fernando Quintero discovered than MoinMoin did not properly sanitize its input when processing login requests, resulting in cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing server output during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain. This issue affected Ubuntu 7.10 and 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2008-0780](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0780))
