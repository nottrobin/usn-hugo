### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

Jack Morgenstein reported a flaw in the page handling of the KVM (Kerenl Virtual Machine) subsystem in the Linux kernel. A guest OS user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (host OS memory corruption) or possibly have other unspecified impact on the host OS. ([CVE-2014-3601](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3601))

Chris Evans reported an flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s handling of iso9660 (compact disk filesystem) images. An attacker who can mount a custom iso9660 image either via a CD/DVD drive or a loopback mount could cause a denial of service (system crash or reboot). ([CVE-2014-5471](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-5471))

Chris Evans reported an flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s handling of iso9660 (compact disk filesystem) images. An attacker who can mount a custom iso9660 image, with a self-referential CL entry, either via a CD/DVD drive or a loopback mount could cause a denial of service (unkillable mount process). ([CVE-2014-5472](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-5472)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-1453-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [3.2.0-1453.73](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1453.73) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
