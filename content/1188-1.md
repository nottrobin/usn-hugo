### ecryptfs-utils vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.04
* Ubuntu 10.10
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

eCryptfs could be tricked into mounting and unmounting arbitrary locations, and possibly disclose confidential information.

### Software description

* ecryptfs-utils 

### Details

Vasiliy Kulikov and Dan Rosenberg discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly validated permissions on the requested mountpoint. A local attacker could use this flaw to mount to arbitrary locations, leading to privilege escalation. ([CVE-2011-1831](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1831))

Vasiliy Kulikov and Dan Rosenberg discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly validated permissions on the requested mountpoint. A local attacker could use this flaw to unmount to arbitrary locations, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1832](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1832))

Vasiliy Kulikov and Dan Rosenberg discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly validated permissions on the requested source directory. A local attacker could use this flaw to mount an arbitrary directory, possibly leading to information disclosure. A pending kernel update will provide the other half of the fix for this issue. ([CVE-2011-1833](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1833))

Dan Rosenberg and Marc Deslauriers discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly handled modifications to the mtab file when an error occurs. A local attacker could use this flaw to corrupt the mtab file, and possibly unmount arbitrary locations, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1834](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1834))

Marc Deslauriers discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly handled keys when setting up an encrypted private directory. A local attacker could use this flaw to manipulate keys during creation of a new user. ([CVE-2011-1835](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1835))

Marc Deslauriers discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly handled permissions during recovery. A local attacker could use this flaw to possibly access another user&#39;s data during the recovery process. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 11.04. ([CVE-2011-1836](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1836))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that eCryptfs incorrectly handled lock counters. A local attacker could use this flaw to possibly overwrite arbitrary files. The default symlink restrictions in Ubuntu 10.10 and 11.04 should protect against this issue. ([CVE-2011-1837](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1837))
