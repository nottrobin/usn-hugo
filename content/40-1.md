### php4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Stefan Esser reported several buffer overflows in PHP&#39;s variable unserializing handling. These could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server with the PHP interpreter&#39;s privileges by sending specially crafted input strings (form data, cookie values, and similar).

Additionally, Ilia Alshanetsky discovered a buffer overflow in the exif_read_data() function. Attackers could execute arbitrary code on the server by sending a JPEG image with a very long &quot;sectionname&quot; value to PHP applications that support image uploads.
