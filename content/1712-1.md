### Details

It was discoverd that Inkscape incorrectly handled XML external entities in SVG files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially-crafted SVG file, Inkscape could possibly include external files in drawings, resulting in information disclosure. ([CVE-2012-5656](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5656))

A local attacker could trick a user into opening a different file than the one that was intended. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 11.10, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 12.10. ([CVE-2012-6076](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-6076))
