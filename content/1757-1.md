    James Kettle discovered that Django did not properly filter the Host HTTP header when processing certain requests. An attacker could exploit this to generate and display arbitrary URLs to users. Although this issue had been previously addressed in USN-1632-1, this update adds additional hardening measures to host header validation. This update also adds a new ALLOWED_HOSTS setting that can be set to a list of acceptable values for headers. ([CVE-2012-4520](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4520))

### Details

James Kettle discovered that Django did not properly filter the Host HTTP header when processing certain requests. An attacker could exploit this to generate and display arbitrary URLs to users. Although this issue had been previously addressed in USN-1632-1, this update adds additional hardening measures to host header validation. This update also adds a new ALLOWED_HOSTS setting that can be set to a list of acceptable values for headers. ([CVE-2012-4520](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4520))

Orange Tsai discovered that Django incorrectly performed permission checks when displaying the history view in the admin interface. An administrator could use this flaw to view the history of any object, regardless of intended permissions. ([CVE-2013-0305](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0305))

It was discovered that Django incorrectly handled a large number of forms when generating formsets. An attacker could use this flaw to cause Django to consume memory, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-0306](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0306))

It was discovered that Django incorrectly deserialized XML. An attacker could use this flaw to perform entity-expansion and external-entity/DTD attacks. This updated modified Django behaviour to no longer allow DTDs, perform entity expansion, or fetch external entities/DTDs. ([CVE-2013-1665](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1664">CVE-2013-1664</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1665))
