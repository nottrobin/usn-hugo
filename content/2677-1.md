### oxide-qt vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 15.04
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Oxide. 

### Software description

* oxide-qt 

### Details

An uninitialized value issue was discovered in ICU. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-1270](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1270))

A use-after-free was discovered in the GPU process implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1272](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1272))

A use-after-free was discovered in the IndexedDB implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1276](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1276))

A use-after-free was discovered in the accessibility implemetation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1277](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1277))

A memory corruption issue was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1280](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1280))

It was discovered that Blink did not properly determine the V8 context of a microtask in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) restrictions. ([CVE-2015-1281](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1281))

Multiple integer overflows were discovered in Expat. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1283](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1283))

It was discovered that Blink did not enforce a page&#39;s maximum number of frames in some circumstances, resulting in a use-after-free. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1284](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1284))

It was discovered that the XSS auditor in Blink did not properly choose a truncation point. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2015-1285](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1285))

An issue was discovered in the CSS implementation in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions. ([CVE-2015-1287](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1287))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1289](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1289))

A use-after-free was discovered in oxide::qt::URLRequestDelegatedJob in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1329](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1329))

A crash was discovered in the regular expression implementation in V8 in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-5605](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-5605))
