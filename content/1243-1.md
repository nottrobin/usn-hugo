### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.10

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

It was discovered that the security fix for [CVE-2011-1479](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4250">CVE-2010-4250</a> introduced a regression. A remote attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1479))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that taskstats did not enforce access restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain information, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2011-2494](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2494))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that /proc/PID/io did not enforce access restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain information, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2011-2495](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2495))

It was discovered that the EXT4 filesystem contained multiple off-by-one flaws. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2695](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2695))

Christian Ohm discovered that the perf command looks for configuration files in the current directory. If a privileged user were tricked into running perf in a directory containing a malicious configuration file, an attacker could run arbitrary commands and possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2011-2905](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2905))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Comedi driver did not correctly clear memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2011-2909](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2909))

Dan Kaminsky discovered that the kernel incorrectly handled random sequence number generation. An attacker could use this flaw to possibly predict sequence numbers and inject packets. ([CVE-2011-3188](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3188))

Yogesh Sharma discovered that CIFS did not correctly handle UNCs that had no prefixpaths. A local attacker with access to a CIFS partition could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-3363](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3363)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:
