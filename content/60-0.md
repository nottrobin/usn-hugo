### linux-source-2.6.8.1 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

CAN-2005-0001:

 Paul Starzetz discovered a race condition in the Linux page fault handler code. This allowed an unprivileged user to gain root privileges on multiprocessor machines under some circumstances. This also affects the Hyper-Threading mode on Pentium 4 processors.

http://lists.netsys.com/pipermail/full-disclosure/2005-January/030660.html:

 Brad Spengler discovered that some device drivers used copy_from_user() (a function to copy data from userspace tools into kernel memory) with insufficient input validation. This potentially allowed users and/or malicious hardware to overwrite kernel memory which could result in a crash (Denial of Service) or even root privilege escalation.

Additionally, this update corrects the SMB file system driver. USN-30-1 fixed some vulnerabilities in this driver (see CAN-2004-0883, CAN-2004-0949). However, it was found that these new validation checks were too strict, which cause some valid operations to fail.
