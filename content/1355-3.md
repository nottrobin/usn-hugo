Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that if a user chose to export their Firefox Sync key the &quot;Firefox Recovery Key.html&quot; file is saved with incorrect permissions, making the file contents potentially readable by other users. ([CVE-2012-0443](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0450">CVE-2012-0450</a>) Nicolas Gregoire and Aki Helin discovered that when processing a malformed embedded XSLT stylesheet, Firefox can crash due to memory corruption. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0449">CVE-2012-0449</a>) It was discovered that memory corruption could occur during the decoding of Ogg Vorbis files. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted file, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0444">CVE-2012-0444</a>) Tim Abraldes discovered that when encoding certain images types the resulting data was always a fixed size. There is the possibility of sensitive data from uninitialized memory being appended to these images. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0447">CVE-2012-0447</a>) It was discovered that Firefox did not properly perform XPConnect security checks. An attacker could exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks through web pages and Firefox extensions. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0446">CVE-2012-0446</a>) It was discovered that Firefox did not properly handle node removal in the DOM. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3659">CVE-2011-3659</a>) Alex Dvorov discovered that Firefox did not properly handle sub-frames in form submissions. An attacker could exploit this to conduct phishing attacks using HTML5 frames. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0445">CVE-2012-0445</a>) Ben Hawkes, Christian Holler, Honza Bombas, Jason Orendorff, Jesse Ruderman, Jan Odvarko, Peter Van Der Beken, Bob Clary, and Bill McCloskey discovered memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0442">CVE-2012-0442</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0443))
