### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.04

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

Timo Warns discovered that the EFI GUID partition table was not correctly parsed. A physically local attacker that could insert mountable devices could exploit this to crash the system or possibly gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-1776](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1776))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the IPv4 diagnostic routines did not correctly validate certain requests. A local attacker could exploit this to consume CPU resources, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2213](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2213))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the Bluetooth stack incorrectly handled certain L2CAP requests. If a system was using Bluetooth, a remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic to crash the system or gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-2497](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2497))

It was discovered that the EXT4 filesystem contained multiple off-by-one flaws. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2695](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2695))

Mauro Carvalho Chehab discovered that the si4713 radio driver did not correctly check the length of memory copies. If this hardware was available, a local attacker could exploit this to crash the system or gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-2700](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2700))

Herbert Xu discovered that certain fields were incorrectly handled when Generic Receive Offload ([CVE-2011-2723](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2723))

Time Warns discovered that long symlinks were incorrectly handled on Be filesystems. A local attacker could exploit this with a malformed Be filesystem and crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2928](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2928))

Dan Kaminsky discovered that the kernel incorrectly handled random sequence number generation. An attacker could use this flaw to possibly predict sequence numbers and inject packets. ([CVE-2011-3188](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3188))

Darren Lavender discovered that the CIFS client incorrectly handled certain large values. A remote attacker with a malicious server could exploit this to crash the system or possibly execute arbitrary code as the root user. ([CVE-2011-3191](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3191)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 11.04
 : [linux-image-2.6.38-1209-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [2.6.38-1209.16](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/2.6.38-1209.16) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.
