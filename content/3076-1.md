If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5257](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5256">CVE-2016-5256</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5257))

Atte Kettunen discovered a heap buffer overflow during text conversion with some unicode characters. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5270](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5270))

Abhishek Arya discovered an out of bounds read during the processing of text runs in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash. ([CVE-2016-5271](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5271))

Abhishek Arya discovered a bad cast when processing layout with input elements in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5272](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5272))

A crash was discovered in accessibility. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5273](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5273))

A use-after-free was discovered in web animations during restyling. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5274](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5274))

A buffer overflow was discovered when working with empty filters during canvas rendering. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5275](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5275))

A use-after-free was discovered in accessibility. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5276](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5276))

A use-after-free was discovered in web animations when destroying a timeline. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5277](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5277))

A buffer overflow was discovered when encoding image frames to images in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5278](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5278))

Rafael Gieschke discovered that the full path of files is available to web pages after a drag and drop operation. An attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-5279](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5279))
