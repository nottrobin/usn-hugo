### rpm vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04
* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

USN-148-1 and USN-151-1 fixed two security flaws in zlib, which could be exploited to cause Denial of Service attacks or even arbitrary code execution with malicious data streams.

Since lsb-rpm is statically linked against the zlib library, it is also affected by these issues. The updated packagages have been rebuilt against the fixed zlib.

Please note that lsb-rpm is not officially supported (it is in the &quot;universe&quot; component of the archive).

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 5.10
 : lsb-rpm 

Ubuntu 5.04
 : lsb-rpm 

Ubuntu 4.10
 : lsb-rpm 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).
