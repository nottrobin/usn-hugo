    Bobby Holley, Carsten Book, Christoph Diehl, Gary Kwong, Jan de Mooij, Jesse Ruderman, Nathan Froyd and Christian Holler discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.

### Details

Bobby Holley, Carsten Book, Christoph Diehl, Gary Kwong, Jan de Mooij, Jesse Ruderman, Nathan Froyd and Christian Holler discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1518](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1518))

Abhishek Arya discovered an out of bounds read when decoding JPG images. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash. ([CVE-2014-1523](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1523))

Abhishek Arya discovered a buffer overflow when a script uses a non-XBL object as an XBL object. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1524](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1524))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that sites with notification permissions can run script in a privileged context in some circumstances. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1529](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1529))

It was discovered that browser history navigations could be used to load a site with the addressbar displaying the wrong address. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting or phishing attacks. ([CVE-2014-1530](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1530))

A use-after-free was discovered when resizing images in some circumstances. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1531](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1531))

Tyson Smith and Jesse Schwartzentruber discovered a use-after-free during host resolution in some circumstances. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1532](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1532))
