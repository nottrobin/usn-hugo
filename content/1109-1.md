    It was discovered that GIMP incorrectly handled malformed data in certain plugin configuration files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted plugin configuration file, an attacker could cause GIMP to crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges. The default compiler options for affected releases should reduce the vulnerability to a denial of service.
