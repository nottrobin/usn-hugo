### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.10

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

 An integer overflow was discovered in the stack randomization feature of the Linux kernel on 64 bit platforms. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to bypass the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) protection mechanism. ([CVE-2015-1593](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1593))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux Kernel&#39;s handling of userspace configuration of the link layer control (LLC). A local user could exploit this flaw to read data from other sysctl settings. ([CVE-2015-2041](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2041))

An information leak was discovered in how the Linux kernel handles setting the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) settings. A local user could exploit this flaw to read data from other sysctl settings. ([CVE-2015-2042](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2042))

A memory corruption flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s scsi subsystem. A local attacker could potentially exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-4036](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-4036)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 14.10
 : [linux-image-3.16.0-34-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.16.0-34.45](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.16.0-34.45) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.16.0-34-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.16.0-34.45](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.16.0-34.45) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.16.0-34-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.16.0-34.45](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.16.0-34.45) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.16.0-34-powerpc64-emb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.16.0-34.45](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.16.0-34.45) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.16.0-34-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.16.0-34.45](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.16.0-34.45) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.16.0-34-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.16.0-34.45](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.16.0-34.45) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.16.0-34-powerpc-e500mc](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.16.0-34.45](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.16.0-34.45) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
