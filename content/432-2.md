### gnupg2, gpgme1.0 vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Details

USN-432-1 fixed a vulnerability in GnuPG. This update provides the corresponding updates for GnuPG2 and the GPGME library.

Original advisory details:

 Gerardo Richarte from Core Security Technologies discovered that when gnupg is used without --status-fd, there is no way to distinguish initial unsigned messages from a following signed message. An attacker could inject an unsigned message, which could fool the user into thinking the message was entirely signed by the original sender.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 6.10
 : libgpgme11 <span>1.1.2-2ubuntu0.1</span>
 : gnupg2 <span>1.9.21-0ubuntu5.3</span>

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : libgpgme11 <span>1.1.0-1ubuntu0.1</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the necessary changes.
