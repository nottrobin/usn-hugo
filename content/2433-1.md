### tcpdump vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.10
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in tcpdump. 

### Software description

* tcpdump 

### Details

Steffen Bauch discovered that tcpdump incorrectly handled printing OSLR packets. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause tcpdump to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-8767](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8767))

Steffen Bauch discovered that tcpdump incorrectly handled printing GeoNet packets. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause tcpdump to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.10. ([CVE-2014-8768](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8768))

Steffen Bauch discovered that tcpdump incorrectly handled printing AODV packets. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause tcpdump to crash, resulting in a denial of service, reveal sensitive information, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-8769](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8769))

It was discovered that tcpdump incorrectly handled printing PPP packets. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause tcpdump to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-9140](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-9140))

In the default installation, attackers would be isolated by the tcpdump AppArmor profile. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 14.10
 : [tcpdump](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tcpdump) <span> [4.6.2-1ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tcpdump/4.6.2-1ubuntu1.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 : [tcpdump](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tcpdump) <span> [4.5.1-2ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tcpdump/4.5.1-2ubuntu1.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [tcpdump](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tcpdump) <span> [4.2.1-1ubuntu2.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tcpdump/4.2.1-1ubuntu2.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [tcpdump](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tcpdump) <span> [4.0.0-6ubuntu3.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/tcpdump/4.0.0-6ubuntu3.1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
