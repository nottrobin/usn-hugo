### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 15.04

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

It was discovered that the SCTP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel performed an incorrect sequence of protocol-initialization steps. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-5283](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-5283))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the Linux kernel&#39;s keyring handler attempted to garbage collect incompletely instantiated keys. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-7872](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7872)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 15.04
 : [linux-image-3.19.0-39-powerpc64-emb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.19.0-39.44](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.19.0-39.44) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.19.0-39-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.19.0-39.44](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.19.0-39.44) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.19.0-39-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.19.0-39.44](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.19.0-39.44) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.19.0-39-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.19.0-39.44](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.19.0-39.44) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.19.0-39-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.19.0-39.44](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.19.0-39.44) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.19.0-39-powerpc-e500mc](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.19.0-39.44](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.19.0-39.44) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.19.0-39-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.19.0-39.44](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.19.0-39.44) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
