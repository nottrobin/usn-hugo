### openssl vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 16.10
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in OpenSSL. 

### Software description

* openssl 

### Details

Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL used undefined behaviour when performing pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS as other releases were fixed in a previous security update. ([CVE-2016-2177](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2177))

It was discovered that OpenSSL did not properly handle Montgomery multiplication, resulting in incorrect results leading to transient failures. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 16.10. ([CVE-2016-7055](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-7055))

It was discovered that OpenSSL did not properly use constant-time operations when performing ECDSA P-256 signing. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a timing attack and recover private ECDSA keys. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2016-7056](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-7056))

Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain warning alerts. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to stop responding, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-8610](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-8610))

Robert Święcki discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain truncated packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2017-3731](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-3731))

It was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly performed the x86_64 Montgomery squaring procedure. While unlikely, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to recover private keys. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 16.10. ([CVE-2017-3732](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-3732))
