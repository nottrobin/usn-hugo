### ca-certificates-java regression

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.10

### Summary

USN-1197-7 introduced a regression in ca-certificates-java. 

### Software description

* ca-certificates-java 

### Details

USN-1197-7 fixed a vulnerability in ca-certificates-java. The new package broke upgrades from Ubuntu 11.04 to Ubuntu 11.10. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that Dutch Certificate Authority DigiNotar had mis-issued multiple fraudulent certificates. These certificates could allow an attacker to perform a &quot;man in the middle&quot; (MITM) attack which would make the user believe their connection is secure, but is actually being monitored. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 11.10
 : [ca-certificates-java](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ca-certificates-java) <span> [20110912ubuntu3.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ca-certificates-java/20110912ubuntu3.2) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
