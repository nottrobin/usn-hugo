### binutils vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.10
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Applications from GNU binutils could be made to crash, run programs, or delete arbitrary files as your login if they opened a specially
crafted file.

### Software description

* binutils 

### Details

Michal Zalewski discovered that the setup_group function in libbfd in GNU binutils did not properly check group headers in ELF files. An attacker could use this to craft input that could cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-8485](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8485))

Hanno Böck discovered that the _bfd_XXi_swap_aouthdr_in function in libbfd in GNU binutils allowed out-of-bounds writes. An attacker could use this to craft input that could cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-8501](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8501))

Hanno Böck discovered a heap-based buffer overflow in the pe_print_edata function in libbfd in GNU binutils. An attacker could use this to craft input that could cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-8502](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8502))

Alexander Cherepanov discovered multiple directory traversal vulnerabilities in GNU binutils. An attacker could use this to craft input that could delete arbitrary files. ([CVE-2014-8737](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8737))

Alexander Cherepanov discovered the _bfd_slurp_extended_name_table function in libbfd in GNU binutils allowed invalid writes when handling extended name tables in an archive. An attacker could use this to craft input that could cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-8738](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8738))

Hanno Böck discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the ihex_scan function in libbfd in GNU binutils. An attacker could use this to craft input that could cause a denial of service (application crash). ([CVE-2014-8503](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8503))

Michal Zalewski discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the srec_scan function in libbfd in GNU binutils. An attacker could use this to to craft input that could cause a denial of service (application crash); the GNU C library&#39;s Fortify Source printf protection should prevent the possibility of executing arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-8504](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8504))

Michal Zalewski discovered that the srec_scan function in libbfd in GNU binutils allowed out-of-bounds reads. An attacker could use this to craft input to cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, and Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-8484](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8484))

Sang Kil Cha discovered multiple integer overflows in the _objalloc_alloc function and objalloc_alloc macro in binutils. This could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service (application crash). This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. ([CVE-2012-3509](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3509))

Alexander Cherepanov and Hanno Böck discovered multiple additional out-of-bounds reads and writes in GNU binutils. An attacker could use these to craft input that could cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. A few of these issues may be limited in exposure to a denial of service (application abort) by the GNU C library&#39;s Fortify Source printf protection.

The strings(1) utility in GNU binutils used libbfd by default when examining executable object files; unfortunately, libbfd was not originally developed with the expectation of hostile input. As a defensive measure, the behavior of strings has been changed to default to &#39;strings --all&#39; behavior, which does not use libbfd; use the new argument to strings, &#39;--data&#39;, to recreate the old behavior. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:
