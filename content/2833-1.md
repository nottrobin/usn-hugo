### Details

Andrei Vaida, Jesse Ruderman, Bob Clary, Christian Holler, Jesse Ruderman, Eric Rahm, Robert Kaiser, Harald Kirschner, and Michael Henretty discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-7202](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7201">CVE-2015-7201</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7202))

Ronald Crane discovered three buffer overflows through code inspection. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-7221](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7203">CVE-2015-7203</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7220">CVE-2015-7220</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7221))

([CVE-2015-7204](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7204))

Ronald Crane discovered a buffer overflow through code inspection. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-7205](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7205))

It was discovered that it is possible to read cross-origin URLs following a redirect if performance.getEntries() is used with an iframe to host a page. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions. ([CVE-2015-7207](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7207))

It was discovered that Firefox allows for control characters to be set in cookies. An attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cookie injection attacks on some web servers. ([CVE-2015-7208](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7208))

Looben Yang discovered a use-after-free in WebRTC when closing channels in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-7210](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7210))

Abdulrahman Alqabandi discovered that hash symbol is incorrectly handled when parsing data: URLs. An attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct URL spoofing attacks. ([CVE-2015-7211](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7211))

Abhishek Arya discovered an integer overflow when allocating large textures. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-7212](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7212))

Ronald Crane dicovered an integer overflow when processing MP4 format video in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-7213](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7213))

Tsubasa Iinuma discovered a way to bypass same-origin restrictions using data: and view-source: URLs. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information and read local files. ([CVE-2015-7214](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7214))

Masato Kinugawa discovered a cross-origin information leak in error events in web workers. An attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2015-7215](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7215))

([CVE-2015-7219](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7218">CVE-2015-7218</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7219))

Gerald Squelart discovered an integer underflow in the libstagefright library when parsing MP4 format video in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-7222](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7222))

Kris Maglione discovered a mechanism where web content could use WebExtension APIs to execute code with the privileges of a particular WebExtension. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website with a vulnerable extension installed, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information or conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
