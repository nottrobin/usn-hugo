### libmms, xine-lib vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04

### Details

Matthias Hopf discovered several buffer overflows in libmms. By tricking a user into opening a specially crafted remote multimedia stream with an application using libmms, a remote attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges.

The Xine library contains an embedded copy of libmms, and thus needs the same security update.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : libxine-main1 <span>1.1.1+ubuntu2-7.2</span>

Ubuntu 5.10
 : libmms0 <span>0.1-0ubuntu1.2</span>
 : libxine1c2 <span>1.0.1-1ubuntu10.4</span>

Ubuntu 5.04
 : libxine1 <span>1.0-1ubuntu3.8</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the necessary changes.
