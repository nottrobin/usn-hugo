### linux-lts-raring vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-raring 

### Details

Sasha Levin reported a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s point-to-point protocol (PPP) when used with the Layer Two Tunneling Protocol (L2TP). A local user could exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2014-4943](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-4943))

Michael S. Tsirkin discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel&#39;s segmentation of skbs when using the zerocopy feature of vhost-net. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to gain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-0131](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-0131))

Salva Peir√≥ discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel&#39;s media- device driver. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1739](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1739))

A bounds check error was discovered in the socket filter subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. ([CVE-2014-3144](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3144))

A remainder calculation error was discovered in the socket filter subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) via crafted BPF instructions. ([CVE-2014-3145](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3145))

An flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s audit subsystem when auditing certain syscalls. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive single-bit values from kernel memory or cause a denial of service (OOPS). ([CVE-2014-3917](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3917))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s implementation of user namespaces with respect to inode permissions. A local user could exploit this flaw by creating a user namespace to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2014-4014](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-4014))

Don Bailey discovered a flaw in the LZO decompress algorithm used by the Linux kernel. An attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or OOPS). ([CVE-2014-4608](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-4608)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.8.0-44-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-raring) <span> [3.8.0-44.66~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-raring/3.8.0-44.66~precise1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
