title: "USN-803-1: dhcp vulnerability"
series: [ ubuntu-6.06-lts]
date: 2009-07-14 12:00:00
description: |
    It was discovered that the DHCP client as included in dhcp3 did not verify the length of certain option fields when processing a response from an IPv4 dhcp server. If a user running Ubuntu 6.06 LTS or 8.04 LTS connected to a malicious dhcp server, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program, typically the &#39;dhcp&#39; user. For users running Ubuntu 8.10 or 9.04, a remote attacker should only be able to cause a denial of service in the DHCP client. In Ubuntu 9.04, attackers would also be isolated by the AppArmor dhclient3 profile.

### dhcp3 vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 9.04
* Ubuntu 8.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* dhcp3 

### Details

It was discovered that the DHCP client as included in dhcp3 did not verify the length of certain option fields when processing a response from an IPv4 dhcp server. If a user running Ubuntu 6.06 LTS or 8.04 LTS connected to a malicious dhcp server, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program, typically the &#39;dhcp&#39; user. For users running Ubuntu 8.10 or 9.04, a remote attacker should only be able to cause a denial of service in the DHCP client. In Ubuntu 9.04, attackers would also be isolated by the AppArmor dhclient3 profile. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 9.04
 : [dhcp3-client](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dhcp3) <span> [3.1.1-5ubuntu8.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dhcp3/3.1.1-5ubuntu8.1) </span> 
 : [dhcp3-client-udeb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dhcp3) <span> [3.1.1-5ubuntu8.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dhcp3/3.1.1-5ubuntu8.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 8.10
 : [dhcp3-client](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dhcp3) <span> [3.1.1-1ubuntu2.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dhcp3/3.1.1-1ubuntu2.1) </span> 
 : [dhcp3-client-udeb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dhcp3) <span> [3.1.1-1ubuntu2.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dhcp3/3.1.1-1ubuntu2.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
 : [dhcp3-client](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dhcp3) <span> [3.0.6.dfsg-1ubuntu9.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dhcp3/3.0.6.dfsg-1ubuntu9.1) </span> 
 : [dhcp3-client-udeb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dhcp3) <span> [3.0.6.dfsg-1ubuntu9.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dhcp3/3.0.6.dfsg-1ubuntu9.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : [dhcp3-client](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dhcp3) <span> [3.0.3-6ubuntu7.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dhcp3/3.0.3-6ubuntu7.1) </span> 
 : [dhcp3-client-udeb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dhcp3) <span> [3.0.3-6ubuntu7.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/dhcp3/3.0.3-6ubuntu7.1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart any DHCP network connections utilizing dhclient3 to effect the necessary changes.
