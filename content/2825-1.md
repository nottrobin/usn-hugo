    Multiple use-after-free bugs were discovered in the application cache implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 15.10
* Ubuntu 15.04
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Oxide. 

### Software description

* oxide-qt 

### Details

Multiple use-after-free bugs were discovered in the application cache implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-6767](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-6765">CVE-2015-6765</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-6766">CVE-2015-6766</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-6767))

Several security issues were discovered in the DOM implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to bypass same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2015-6770](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-6768">CVE-2015-6768</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-6770))

A security issue was discovered in the provisional-load commit implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2015-6769](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-6769))

An out-of-bounds read was discovered in the array map and filter operations in V8 in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash. ([CVE-2015-6771](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-6771))

It was discovered that the DOM implementation in Chromium does not prevent javascript: URL navigation while a document is being detached. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2015-6772](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-6772))

An out-of bounds read was discovered in Skia in some cirumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash. ([CVE-2015-6773](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-6773))

A use-after-free was discovered in the DOM implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-6777](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-6777))

It was discovered that the Document::open function in Chromium did not ensure that page-dismissal event handling is compatible with modal dialog blocking. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof application UI content. ([CVE-2015-6782](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-6782))

It was discovered that the page serializer in Chromium mishandled MOTW comments for URLs in some circumstances. An attacker could potentially exploit this to inject HTML content. ([CVE-2015-6784](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-6784))

It was discovered that the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in Chromium accepted an x.y hostname as a match for a *.x.y pattern. An attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass intended access restrictions. ([CVE-2015-6785](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-6785))

It was discovered that the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in Chromium accepted blob:, data: and filesystem: URLs as a match for a * pattern. An attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass intended access restrictions. ([CVE-2015-6786](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-6786))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-6787](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-6787))

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-8478](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8478))
