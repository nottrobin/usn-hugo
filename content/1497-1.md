    Matthias Weckbecker discovered that, when using the OpenStack API to setup libvirt-based hypervisors, an authenticated user could inject files in arbitrary locations on the file system of the host running Nova. A remote attacker could use this to gain root privileges. This issue only affects Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. ([CVE-2012-3360](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3360))
