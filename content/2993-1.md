    Christian Holler, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Tyson Smith, Timothy Nikkel, Sylvestre Ledru, Julian Seward, Olli Pettay, Karl Tomlinson, Christoph Diehl, Julian Hector, Jan de Mooij, Mats Palmgren, and Tooru Fujisawa discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code.

A buffer overflow was discovered when parsing HTML5 fragments in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2819](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2819))

A use-after-free was discovered in contenteditable mode in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code.

A use-after-free was discovered when processing WebGL content in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code.
