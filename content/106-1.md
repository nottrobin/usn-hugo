### gaim vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Jean-Yves Lefort discovered a buffer overflow in the gaim_markup_strip_html() function. This caused Gaim to crash when receiving certain malformed HTML messages. (CAN-2005-0965)

Jean-Yves Lefort also noticed that many functions that handle IRC commands do not escape received HTML metacharacters; this allowed remote attackers to cause a Denial of Service by injecting arbitrary HTML code into the conversation window, popping up arbitrarily many empty dialog boxes, or even causing Gaim to crash. (CAN-2005-0966)

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 4.10
