### openssl vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 7.04
* Ubuntu 6.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* openssl 

### Details

It was discovered that OpenSSL did not correctly perform Montgomery multiplications. Local attackers might be able to reconstruct RSA private keys by examining another user&#39;s OpenSSL processes. ([CVE-2007-3108](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-3108))

Moritz Jodeit discovered that OpenSSL&#39;s SSL_get_shared_ciphers function did not correctly check the size of the buffer it was writing to. A remote attacker could exploit this to write one NULL byte past the end of an application&#39;s cipher list buffer, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution or a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-5135](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-5135)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 7.04
 : [libssl0.9.8](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl) <span> [0.9.8c-4ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/0.9.8c-4ubuntu0.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 6.10
 : [libssl0.9.8](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl) <span> [0.9.8b-2ubuntu2.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/0.9.8b-2ubuntu2.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : [libssl0.9.8](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl) <span> [0.9.8a-7ubuntu0.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/0.9.8a-7ubuntu0.4) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to effect the necessary changes.
