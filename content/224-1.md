    Ga�Delalleau discovered a buffer overflow in the env_opt_add() function of the Kerberos 4 and 5 telnet clients. By sending specially crafted replies, a malicious telnet server could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the telnet client.

### krb4, krb5 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.04
* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Ga�Delalleau discovered a buffer overflow in the env_opt_add() function of the Kerberos 4 and 5 telnet clients. By sending specially crafted replies, a malicious telnet server could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the telnet client. ([CVE-2005-0468](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2005-0468))

Ga�Delalleau discovered a buffer overflow in the handling of the LINEMODE suboptions in the telnet clients of Kerberos 4 and 5. By sending a specially constructed reply containing a large number of SLC (Set Local Character) commands, a remote attacker (i. e. a malicious telnet server) could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running the telnet client. ([CVE-2005-0469](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2005-0469))

Daniel Wachdorf discovered two remote vulnerabilities in the Key Distribution Center of Kerberos 5 (krb5-kdc). By sending certain TCP connection requests, a remote attacker could trigger a double-freeing of memory, which led to memory corruption and a crash of the KDC server. ([CVE-2005-1175](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2005-1174">CVE-2005-1174</a>). Under rare circumstances the same type of TCP connection requests could also trigger a buffer overflow that could be exploited to run arbitrary code with the privileges of the KDC server. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2005-1175))

Magnus Hagander discovered that the krb5_recvauth() function attempted to free previously freed memory in some situations. A remote attacker could possibly exploit this to run arbitrary code with the privileges of the program that called this function. Most imporantly, this affects the following daemons: kpropd (from the krb5-kdc package), klogind, and kshd (both from the krb5-rsh-server package). ([CVE-2005-1689](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2005-1689))

Please note that these packages are not officially supported by Ubuntu (they are in the &#39;universe&#39; component of the archive).

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 5.04
 : krb5-kdc 
 : krb5-rsh-server 
 : krb5-clients 
 : krb5-telnetd 
 : kerberos4kth-clients 

Ubuntu 4.10
 : krb5-kdc 
 : krb5-rsh-server 
 : krb5-clients 
 : krb5-telnetd 
 : kerberos4kth-clients 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).
