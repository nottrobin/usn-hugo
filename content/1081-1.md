### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.10

### Summary

Multiple kernel flaws. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

 It was discovered that KVM did not correctly initialize certain CPU registers. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2010-3698](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-3698))

Thomas Pollet discovered that the RDS network protocol did not check certain iovec buffers. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system or possibly execute arbitrary code as the root user. ([CVE-2010-3865](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-3865))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Linux kernel X.25 implementation did not correctly clear kernel memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2010-3875](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-3875))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Linux kernel sockets implementation did not properly initialize certain structures. A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2010-3876](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-3876))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the TIPC interface did not correctly initialize certain structures. A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2010-3877](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-3877))

Nelson Elhage discovered that the Linux kernel IPv4 implementation did not properly audit certain bytecodes in netlink messages. A local attacker could exploit this to cause the kernel to hang, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2010-3880](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-3880))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the ivtv V4L driver did not correctly initialize certian structures. A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2010-4079](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4079))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the semctl syscall did not correctly clear kernel memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2010-4083](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4083))

It was discovered that multithreaded exec did not handle CPU timers correctly. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2010-4248](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4248))

Vegard Nossum discovered a leak in the kernel&#39;s inotify_init() system call. A local, unprivileged user could exploit this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2010-4250](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4250))

Nelson Elhage discovered that Econet did not correctly handle AUN packets over UDP. A local attacker could send specially crafted traffic to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2010-4342](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4342))

Tavis Ormandy discovered that the install_special_mapping function could bypass the mmap_min_addr restriction. A local attacker could exploit this to mmap 4096 bytes below the mmap_min_addr area, possibly improving the chances of performing NULL pointer dereference attacks. ([CVE-2010-4346](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4346))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the OSS subsystem did not handle name termination correctly. A local attacker could exploit this crash the system or gain root privileges. ([CVE-2010-4527](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4527))

An error was reported in the kernel&#39;s ORiNOCO wireless driver&#39;s handling of TKIP countermeasures. This reduces the amount of time an attacker needs breach a wireless network using WPA+TKIP for security. ([CVE-2010-4648](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4648))

Dan Carpenter discovered that the Infiniband driver did not correctly handle certain requests. A local user could exploit this to crash the system or potentially gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-1044](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4649">CVE-2010-4649</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1044))

An error was discovered in the kernel&#39;s handling of CUSE (Character device in Userspace). A local attacker might exploit this flaw to escalate privilege, if access to /dev/cuse has been modified to allow non-root users. ([CVE-2010-4650](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4650))

A flaw was found in the kernel&#39;s Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA). Changes made by an attacker might not be discovered by IMA, if SELinux was disabled, and a new IMA rule was loaded. ([CVE-2011-0006](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0006))

It was discovered that some import kernel threads can be blocked by a user level process. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-4621](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4621)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
