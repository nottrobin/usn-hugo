    Bobby Holley, Christian Holler, David Bolter, Byron Campen, Jon Coppeard, Carsten Book, Martijn Wargers, Shih-Chiang Chien, Terrence Cole and Jeff Walden discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
