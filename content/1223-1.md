### puppet vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.04
* Ubuntu 10.10
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Puppet could be made to overwrite files and run programs with administrator privileges.

### Software description

* puppet 

### Details

It was discovered that Puppet unsafely opened files when the k5login type is used to manage files. A local attacker could exploit this to overwrite arbitrary files which could be used to escalate privileges. ([CVE-2011-3869](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3869))

Ricky Zhou discovered that Puppet did not drop privileges when creating SSH authorized_keys files. A local attacker could exploit this to overwrite arbitrary files as root. ([CVE-2011-3870](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3870))

It was discovered that Puppet used a predictable filename when using the --edit resource. A local attacker could exploit this to edit arbitrary files or run arbitrary code as the user invoking the program, typically root. ([CVE-2011-3871](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3871))
