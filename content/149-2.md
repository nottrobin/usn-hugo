    USN-149-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in the Firefox web browser. Unfortunately that update introduced a lot of regressions, especially when using extensions, so another update is necessary. The new packages ship Firefox version 1.0.6 which should now work well with most extensions (one known exception is the package &quot;mozilla-tabextensions&quot;).
