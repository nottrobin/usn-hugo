### Details

USN-930-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox and Xulrunner. This update provides the corresponding updates for Ubuntu 9.04 and 9.10, along with additional updates affecting Firefox 3.6.6.

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine of Firefox. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could use this to crash the browser or possibly run arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-1212](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1208">CVE-2010-1208</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1209">CVE-2010-1209</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1211">CVE-2010-1211</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1212))

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

Mozilla has changed the support model for Firefox and they no longer support version 3.0 of the browser and will only support version 3.5 of the browser for a while longer. As a result, Ubuntu is providing an upgrade to Firefox 3.6 for Ubuntu 9.04 and 9.10 users, which is the most current stable release of Firefox supported by Mozilla. When upgrading, users should be aware of the following:

- Firefox 3.6 does not support version 5 of the Sun Java plugin. Please use icedtea6-plugin or sun-java6-plugin instead. - After upgrading to Firefox 3.6.6, users may be prompted to upgrade 3rd party Add-Ons. In some cases, an Add-On will not be compatible with Firefox 3.6.6 and have no update available. In these cases, Firefox will notify the user that it is disabling the Add-On. - Font configuration cannot be controlled via Gnome settings. This is a known issue being tracked in https://launchpad.net/bugs/559149 and will be fixed in a later update. - helix-player is not currently supported in Firefox 3.6. This is a known issue and may be fixed in a future update. - Plugins using external helpers (such as Totem) may not close when using the Epiphany browser. This is a known issue being tracked in https://launchpad.net/bugs/599796 and will be fixed in a later update. This issue only affects Ubuntu 9.04. - The OpenJDK java plugin is not available in Ubuntu 9.04 on Sparc hardware. This will be fixed in a future update.

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Firefox and any applications that use Xulrunner to effect the necessary changes.
