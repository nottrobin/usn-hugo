    It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did not ensure a data structure was initialized before referencing it after an error condition occurred. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4470](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4470))

### linux-lts-trusty vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-trusty 

### Details

It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did not ensure a data structure was initialized before referencing it after an error condition occurred. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4470](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4470))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the netlink implementation of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-5243](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5243)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-93-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty) <span> [3.13.0-93.140~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-93.140~precise1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-93-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty) <span> [3.13.0-93.140~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-93.140~precise1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
