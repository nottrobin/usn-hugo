### libarchive-tar-perl, perl vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 7.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* libarchive-tar-perl 

* perl 

### Details

Jonathan Smith discovered that the Archive::Tar Perl module did not correctly handle symlinks when extracting archives. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted tar file, a remote attacker could over-write arbitrary files. ([CVE-2007-4829](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-4829))

Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry discovered that Perl did not correctly handle certain utf8 characters in regular expressions. If a user or automated system were tricked into using a specially crafted expression, a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial of service. Ubuntu 8.10 was not affected by this issue. ([CVE-2008-1927](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-1927))

A race condition was discovered in the File::Path Perl module&#39;s rmtree function. If a local attacker successfully raced another user&#39;s call of rmtree, they could create arbitrary setuid binaries. Ubuntu 6.06 and 8.10 were not affected by this issue. ([CVE-2008-5302](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5302))

A race condition was discovered in the File::Path Perl module&#39;s rmtree function. If a local attacker successfully raced another user&#39;s call of rmtree, they could delete arbitrary files. Ubuntu 6.06 was not affected by this issue. ([CVE-2008-5303](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5303))
