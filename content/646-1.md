### rdesktop vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 7.10
* Ubuntu 7.04
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* rdesktop 

### Details

It was discovered that rdesktop did not properly validate the length of packet headers when processing RDP requests. If a user were tricked into connecting to a malicious server, an attacker could cause a denial of service or possible execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. ([CVE-2008-1801](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-1801))

Multiple buffer overflows were discovered in rdesktop when processing RDP redirect requests. If a user were tricked into connecting to a malicious server, an attacker could cause a denial of service or possible execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. ([CVE-2008-1802](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-1802))

It was discovered that rdesktop performed a signed integer comparison when reallocating dynamic buffers which could result in a heap-based overflow. If a user were tricked into connecting to a malicious server, an attacker could cause a denial of service or possible execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. ([CVE-2008-1802](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-1802))
