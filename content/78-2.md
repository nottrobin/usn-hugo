### mailman vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Ubuntu Security Announce USN-78-1 described a path traversal vulnerability in the &quot;private&quot; module of Mailman. Unfortunately this updated mailman package was broken so that the &quot;private&quot; module could not be executed at all any more. The latest package version fixes this.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

For reference, this is the description of the original USN:

 An path traversal vulnerability has been discovered in the &quot;private&quot; module of Mailman. A flawed path sanitation algorithm allowed the construction of URLS to arbitrary files readable by Mailman. This allowed a remote attacker to retrieve configuration and password databases, private list archives, and other files.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 4.10
 : mailman 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).
