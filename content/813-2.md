### apache2 vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* apache2 

### Details

USN-813-1 fixed vulnerabilities in apr. This update provides the corresponding updates for apr as provided by Apache on Ubuntu 6.06 LTS.

Original advisory details:

 Matt Lewis discovered that apr did not properly sanitize its input when allocating memory. If an application using apr processed crafted input, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or potentially execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the application. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : [libapr0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apache2) <span> [2.0.55-4ubuntu2.7](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apache2/2.0.55-4ubuntu2.7) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart any applications using apr, such as Subversion and Apache, to effect the necessary changes.
