    Moxie Marlinspike discovered that NSS did not properly handle regular expressions in certificate names. A remote attacker could create a specially crafted certificate to cause a denial of service (via application crash) or execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

### nss vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 9.04
* Ubuntu 8.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Software description

* nss 

### Details

Moxie Marlinspike discovered that NSS did not properly handle regular expressions in certificate names. A remote attacker could create a specially crafted certificate to cause a denial of service (via application crash) or execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-2404](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-2404))

Moxie Marlinspike and Dan Kaminsky independently discovered that NSS did not properly handle certificates with NULL characters in the certificate name. An attacker could exploit this to perform a man in the middle attack to view sensitive information or alter encrypted communications. ([CVE-2009-2408](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-2408))

Dan Kaminsky discovered NSS would still accept certificates with MD2 hash signatures. As a result, an attacker could potentially create a malicious trusted certificate to impersonate another site. ([CVE-2009-2409](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-2409)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 9.04
 : [libnss3-1d](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nss) <span> [3.12.3.1-0ubuntu0.9.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nss/3.12.3.1-0ubuntu0.9.04.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 8.10
 : [libnss3-1d](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nss) <span> [3.12.3.1-0ubuntu0.8.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nss/3.12.3.1-0ubuntu0.8.10.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
 : [libnss3-1d](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nss) <span> [3.12.3.1-0ubuntu0.8.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nss/3.12.3.1-0ubuntu0.8.04.1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart any applications that use NSS, such as Firefox, to effect the necessary changes.
