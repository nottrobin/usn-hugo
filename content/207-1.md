series: [ ubuntu-4.10]
date: 2005-10-17 12:00:00
description: |
    A bug has been found in the handling of the open_basedir directive handling. Contrary to the specification, the value of open_basedir was handled as a prefix instead of a proper directory name even if it was terminated by a slash (&#39;/&#39;). For example, this allowed PHP scripts to access the directory /home/user10 when open_basedir was configured to &#39;/home/user1/&#39;.
