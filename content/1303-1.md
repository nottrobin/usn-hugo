### linux-mvl-dove vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.10

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-mvl-dove 

### Details

Peter Huewe discovered an information leak in the handling of reading security-related TPM data. A local, unprivileged user could read the results of a previous TPM command. ([CVE-2011-1162](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1162))

A bug was discovered in the XFS filesystem&#39;s handling of pathnames. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service, or gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-4077](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4077))

Nick Bowler discovered the kernel GHASH message digest algorithm incorrectly handled error conditions. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a kernel oops. ([CVE-2011-4081](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4081))

A flaw was found in the Journaling Block Device (JBD). A local attacker able to mount ext3 or ext4 file systems could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-4132](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4132))

A bug was found in the way headroom check was performed in udp6_ufo_fragment() function. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system. ([CVE-2011-4326](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4326))

Clement Lecigne discovered a bug in the HFS file system bounds checking. When a malformed HFS file system is mounted a local user could crash the system or gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-4330](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4330)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.10
 : [linux-image-2.6.32-421-dove](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-mvl-dove) <span> [2.6.32-421.39](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-mvl-dove/2.6.32-421.39) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
