    Andrey Konovalov discovered that the CDC Network Control Model USB driver in the Linux kernel did not cancel work events queued if a later error occurred, resulting in a use-after-free. An attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3951](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-3951))

### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the CDC Network Control Model USB driver in the Linux kernel did not cancel work events queued if a later error occurred, resulting in a use-after-free. An attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3951](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-3951))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the core USB implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-4482](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4482))

Jann Horn discovered that the InfiniBand interfaces within the Linux kernel could be coerced into overwriting kernel memory. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to possibly gain administrative privileges on systems where InifiniBand related kernel modules are loaded. ([CVE-2016-4565](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4565))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the timer handling implementation in the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-4578](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4569">CVE-2016-4569</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4578))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the X.25 Call Request handling in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-4580](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4580))

Baozeng Ding discovered a use-after-free issue in the generic PPP layer in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4805](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4805))

It was discovered that an information leak exists in the Rock Ridge implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker who is able to mount a malicious iso9660 file system image could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-4913](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4913)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-1483-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [3.2.0-1483.110](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1483.110) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
