### linux-lts-backport-maverick vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-backport-maverick 

### Details

 Peter Huewe discovered an information leak in the handling of reading security-related TPM data. A local, unprivileged user could read the results of a previous TPM command. ([CVE-2011-1162](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1162))

Dan Rosenberg reported an error in the old ABI compatibility layer of ARM kernels. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service or gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-1759](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1759))

Ben Hutchings reported a flaw in the kernel&#39;s handling of corrupt LDM partitions. A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service or escalate privileges. ([CVE-2011-2182](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2182))

Clement Lecigne discovered a bug in the HFS filesystem. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a kernel oops. ([CVE-2011-2203](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2203))

A flaw was found in how the Linux kernel handles user-defined key types. An unprivileged local user could exploit this to crash the system. ([CVE-2011-4110](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4110)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-2.6.35-32-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-maverick) <span> [2.6.35-32.64~lucid1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-maverick/2.6.35-32.64~lucid1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-2.6.35-32-server](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-maverick) <span> [2.6.35-32.64~lucid1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-maverick/2.6.35-32.64~lucid1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-2.6.35-32-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-maverick) <span> [2.6.35-32.64~lucid1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-maverick/2.6.35-32.64~lucid1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-2.6.35-32-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-maverick) <span> [2.6.35-32.64~lucid1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-maverick/2.6.35-32.64~lucid1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
