### linux-lts-backport-maverick vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-backport-maverick 

### Details

Aristide Fattori and Roberto Paleari reported a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s handling of IPv4 icmp packets. A remote user could exploit this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1927](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1927))

A flaw was found in the Linux Ethernet bridge&#39;s handling of IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) packets. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to crash the system. ([CVE-2011-0716](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0716))

Han-Wen Nienhuys reported a flaw in the FUSE kernel module. A local user who can mount a FUSE file system could cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-3353](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3353))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s AppArmor security interface when invalid information was written to it. An unprivileged local user could use this to cause a denial of service on the system. ([CVE-2011-3619](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3619))

A flaw was found in KVM&#39;s Programmable Interval Timer (PIT). When a virtual interrupt control is not available a local user could use this to cause a denial of service by starting a timer. ([CVE-2011-4622](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4622))

A flaw was discovered in the XFS filesystem. If a local user mounts a specially crafted XFS image it could potential execute arbitrary code on the system. ([CVE-2012-0038](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0038))

Chen Haogang discovered an integer overflow that could result in memory corruption. A local unprivileged user could use this to crash the system. ([CVE-2012-0044](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0044))
