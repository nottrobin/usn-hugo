    Benoit Jacob, Olli Pettay, Jan Varga, Jan de Mooij, Jesse Ruderman, Dan Gohman, Christoph Diehl, Gregor Wagner, Gary Kwong, Luke Wagner, Rob Fletcher and Makoto Kato discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
