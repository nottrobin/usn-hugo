title: "USN-156-1: TIFF vulnerability"
releases: [ ubuntu-04.10 ]
date: 2005-07-29 12:00:00
description: |
    Wouter Hanegraaff discovered that the TIFF library did not sufficiently validate the &quot;YCbCr subsampling&quot; value in TIFF image headers. Decoding a malicious image with a zero value resulted in an arithmetic exception, which caused the program that uses the TIFF library to crash. This leads to a Denial of Service in server applications that use libtiff (like the CUPS printing system) and can cause data loss in, for example, the Evolution email client.
