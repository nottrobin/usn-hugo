### Details

Various flaws were discovered in the browser and JavaScript engine. By tricking a user into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2008-0413](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0412">CVE-2008-0412</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0413))

Flaws were discovered in the file upload form control. A malicious website could force arbitrary files from the user&#39;s computer to be uploaded without consent. ([CVE-2008-0414](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0414))

Various flaws were discovered in the JavaScript engine. By tricking a user into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could escalate privileges within the browser, perform cross-site scripting attacks and/or execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2008-0415](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0415))

Various flaws were discovered in character encoding handling. If a user were ticked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could perform cross-site scripting attacks. ([CVE-2008-0416](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0416))

Justin Dolske discovered a flaw in the password saving mechanism. By tricking a user into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could corrupt the user&#39;s stored passwords. ([CVE-2008-0417](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0417))

Gerry Eisenhaur discovered that the chrome URI scheme did not properly guard against directory traversal. Under certain circumstances, an attacker may be able to load files or steal session data. Ubuntu is not vulnerable in the default installation. ([CVE-2008-0418](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0418))

David Bloom discovered flaws in the way images are treated by the browser. A malicious website could exploit this to steal the user&#39;s history information, crash the browser and/or possibly execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2008-0419](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0419))

Flaws were discovered in the BMP decoder. By tricking a user into opening a specially crafted BMP file, an attacker could obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2008-0420](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0420))

Michal Zalewski discovered flaws with timer-enabled security dialogs. A malicious website could force the user to confirm a security dialog without explicit consent. ([CVE-2008-0591](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0591))
