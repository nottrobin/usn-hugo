A malicious Gopher server could crash squid by sending a line bigger than 4096 bytes. (CAN-2005-0094)

If squid is configured to send WCPP (Web Cache Communication Protocol) messages to a &quot;home router&quot;, an attacker who was able to send UDP packets with a forged source address of this router could crash the

erver with a specially crafted WCPP message. (CAN-2005-0095)

Previous versions of squid have a memory leak which gradually cause memory exhaustion and eventual termination. (CAN-2005-0096)

A remote attacker could crash the server by sending a specially crafted NTLM type 3 packet. (CAN-2005-0097)
