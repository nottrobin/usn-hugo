### linux-mvl-dove vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.10

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-mvl-dove 

### Details

Clement Lecigne discovered a bug in the HFS filesystem. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a kernel oops. ([CVE-2011-2203](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2203))

A flaw was found in how the Linux kernel handles user-defined key types. An unprivileged local user could exploit this to crash the system. ([CVE-2011-4110](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4110)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.10
 : [linux-image-2.6.32-422-dove](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-mvl-dove) <span> [2.6.32-422.40](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-mvl-dove/2.6.32-422.40) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
