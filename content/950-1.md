### mysql-dfsg-5.0, mysql-dfsg-5.1 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 9.10
* Ubuntu 9.04
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* mysql-dfsg-5.0 

* mysql-dfsg-5.1 

### Details

It was discovered that MySQL did not check privileges before uninstalling plugins. An authenticated user could uninstall arbitrary plugins, bypassing intended restrictions. This issue only affected Ubuntu 9.10 and 10.04 LTS. ([CVE-2010-1621](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1621))

It was discovered that MySQL could be made to delete another user&#39;s data and index files. An authenticated user could use symlinks combined with the DROP TABLE command to possibly bypass privilege checks. ([CVE-2010-1626](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1626))

It was discovered that MySQL incorrectly validated the table name argument of the COM_FIELD_LIST command. An authenticated user could use a specially- crafted table name to bypass privilege checks and possibly access other tables. ([CVE-2010-1848](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1848))

Eric Day discovered that MySQL incorrectly handled certain network packets. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw and cause the server to consume all available resources, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2010-1849](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1849))

It was discovered that MySQL performed incorrect bounds checking on the table name argument of the COM_FIELD_LIST command. An authenticated user could use a specially-crafted table name to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. The default compiler options for affected releases should reduce the vulnerability to a denial of service. ([CVE-2010-1850](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1850))
