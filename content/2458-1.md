    Christian Holler, Patrick McManus, Christoph Diehl, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Byron Campen, Terrence Cole, and Nils Ohlmeier discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

### Details

Christian Holler, Patrick McManus, Christoph Diehl, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Byron Campen, Terrence Cole, and Nils Ohlmeier discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-8635](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8634">CVE-2014-8634</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8635))

Bobby Holley discovered that some DOM objects with certain properties can bypass XrayWrappers in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass security restrictions. ([CVE-2014-8636](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8636))

Michal Zalewski discovered a use of uninitialized memory when rendering malformed bitmap images on a canvas element. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to steal confidential information. ([CVE-2014-8637](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8637))

Muneaki Nishimura discovered that requests from navigator.sendBeacon() lack an origin header. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site request forgery (XSRF) attacks. ([CVE-2014-8638](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8638))

Xiaofeng Zheng discovered that a web proxy returning a 407 response could inject cookies in to the originally requested domain. If a user connected to a malicious web proxy, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct session-fixation attacks. ([CVE-2014-8639](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8639))

Holger Fuhrmannek discovered a crash in Web Audio while manipulating timelines. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2014-8640](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8640))

Mitchell Harper discovered a use-after-free in WebRTC. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-8641](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8641))

Brian Smith discovered that OCSP responses would fail to verify if signed by a delegated OCSP responder certificate with the id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck extension, potentially allowing a user to connect to a site with a revoked certificate. ([CVE-2014-8642](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8642))
