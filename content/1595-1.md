    Chris Evans discovered that libxslt incorrectly handled generate-id XPath functions. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted XSLT document, a remote attacker could obtain potentially sensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and Ubuntu 11.04. ([CVE-2011-1202](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1202))

### libxslt vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 11.10
* Ubuntu 11.04
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Summary

Applications using libxslt could be made to crash or run programs as your login if they processed a specially crafted file.

### Software description

* libxslt 

### Details

Chris Evans discovered that libxslt incorrectly handled generate-id XPath functions. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted XSLT document, a remote attacker could obtain potentially sensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and Ubuntu 11.04. ([CVE-2011-1202](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1202))

It was discovered that libxslt incorrectly parsed certain patterns. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted XSLT document, a remote attacker could cause libxslt to crash, causing a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-3970](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3970))

Nicholas Gregoire discovered that libxslt incorrectly handled unexpected DTD nodes. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted XSLT document, a remote attacker could cause libxslt to crash, causing a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-2825](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2825))

Nicholas Gregoire discovered that libxslt incorrectly managed memory. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted XSLT document, a remote attacker could cause libxslt to crash, causing a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-2870](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2870))

Nicholas Gregoire discovered that libxslt incorrectly handled certain transforms. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted XSLT document, a remote attacker could cause libxslt to crash, causing a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2012-2871](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2871))

Cris Neckar discovered that libxslt incorrectly managed memory. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted XSLT document, a remote attacker could cause libxslt to crash, causing a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2012-2893](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2893))
