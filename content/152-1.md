series: [ ubuntu-04.10]
date: 2005-07-21 12:00:00
description: |
    Andrea Barisani discovered a flaw in the SSL handling of pam-ldap and libnss-ldap. When a client connected to a slave LDAP server using SSL, the slave server did not use SSL as well when contacting the LDAP master server. This caused passwords and other confident information to be transmitted unencrypted between the slave and the master.
