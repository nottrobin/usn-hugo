    Dan Rosenberg discovered that multiple terminal ioctls did not correctly initialize structure memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read portions of kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy.

### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.10

### Summary

Multiple kernel flaws have been fixed. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

Dan Rosenberg discovered that multiple terminal ioctls did not correctly initialize structure memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read portions of kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2010-4077](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4076">CVE-2010-4076</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4077))

Neil Horman discovered that NFSv4 did not correctly handle certain orders of operation with ACL data. A remote attacker with access to an NFSv4 mount could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1090](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1090))

Timo Warns discovered that OSF partition parsing routines did not correctly clear memory. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted block device to read kernel memory, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2011-1163](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1163))

Timo Warns discovered that the GUID partition parsing routines did not correctly validate certain structures. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted block device to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1577](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1577))

Oliver Hartkopp and Dave Jones discovered that the CAN network driver did not correctly validate certain socket structures. If this driver was loaded, a local attacker could crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1598](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1598))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the AGP driver did not check the size of certain memory allocations. A local attacker with access to the video subsystem could exploit this to run the system out of memory, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1746](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1746)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:
