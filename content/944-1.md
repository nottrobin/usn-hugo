    Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that the GNU C library did not correctly handle integer overflows in the strfmon function.  If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted format string, a remote attacker could crash applications, leading to a denial of service. (Ubuntu 10.04 was not affected.) ([CVE-2008-1391](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-1391))

### glibc, eglibc vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 9.10
* Ubuntu 9.04
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Summary

The GNU C library did not correctly handle certain mnt entries, strfmon arguments, and ELF program headers.

### Software description

* eglibc 

* glibc 

### Details

Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that the GNU C library did not correctly handle integer overflows in the strfmon function. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted format string, a remote attacker could crash applications, leading to a denial of service. (Ubuntu 10.04 was not affected.) ([CVE-2008-1391](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-1391))

Jeff Layton and Dan Rosenberg discovered that the GNU C library did not correctly handle newlines in the mntent family of functions. If a local attacker were able to inject newlines into a mount entry through other vulnerable mount helpers, they could disrupt the system or possibly gain root privileges. ([CVE-2010-0296](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-0296))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the GNU C library did not correctly validate certain ELF program headers. If a user or automated system were tricked into verifying a specially crafted ELF program, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2010-0830](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-0830)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [libc6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/eglibc) <span> [2.11.1-0ubuntu7.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/eglibc/2.11.1-0ubuntu7.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 9.10
 : [libc6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/eglibc) <span> [2.10.1-0ubuntu17](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/eglibc/2.10.1-0ubuntu17) </span> 

Ubuntu 9.04
 : [libc6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glibc) <span> [2.9-4ubuntu6.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glibc/2.9-4ubuntu6.2) </span> 

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
 : [libc6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glibc) <span> [2.7-10ubuntu6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glibc/2.7-10ubuntu6) </span> 

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : [libc6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glibc) <span> [2.3.6-0ubuntu20.6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glibc/2.3.6-0ubuntu20.6) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to restart all services to make the necessary changes.
