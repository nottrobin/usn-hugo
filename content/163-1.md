    xpdf and kpdf did not sufficiently verify the validity of the &quot;loca&quot; table in PDF files, a table that contains glyph description information for embedded TrueType fonts. After detecting the broken table, xpdf attempted to reconstruct the information in it, which caused the generation of a huge temporary file that quickly filled up available disk space and rendered the application unresponsive.

### xpdf vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.04
* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

xpdf and kpdf did not sufficiently verify the validity of the &quot;loca&quot; table in PDF files, a table that contains glyph description information for embedded TrueType fonts. After detecting the broken table, xpdf attempted to reconstruct the information in it, which caused the generation of a huge temporary file that quickly filled up available disk space and rendered the application unresponsive.

The CUPS printing system in Ubuntu 5.04 uses the xpdf-utils package to convert PDF files to PostScript. By attempting to print such a crafted PDF file, a remote attacker could cause a Denial of Service in a print server. The CUPS system in Ubuntu 4.10 is not vulnerable against this attack.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 5.04
 : xpdf-utils 
 : xpdf-reader 
 : kpdf 

Ubuntu 4.10
 : xpdf-utils 
 : xpdf-reader 
 : kpdf 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).
