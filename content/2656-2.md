This update provides the corresponding update for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

Original advisory details:

 Karthikeyan Bhargavan discovered that NSS incorrectly handled state transitions for the TLS state machine. If a remote attacker were able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to skip the ServerKeyExchange message and remove the forward-secrecy property. ([CVE-2015-4000](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2721">CVE-2015-2721</a>) Looben Yan discovered 2 use-after-free issues when using XMLHttpRequest in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2722">CVE-2015-2722</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2733">CVE-2015-2733</a>) Bob Clary, Christian Holler, Bobby Holley, Andrew McCreight, Terrence Cole, Steve Fink, Mats Palmgren, Wes Kocher, Andreas Pehrson, Tooru Fujisawa, Andrew Sutherland, and Gary Kwong discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2724">CVE-2015-2724</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2725">CVE-2015-2725</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2726">CVE-2015-2726</a>) Armin Razmdjou discovered that opening hyperlinks with specific mouse and key combinations could allow a Chrome privileged URL to be opened without context restrictions being preserved. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass security restrictions. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2727">CVE-2015-2727</a>) Paul Bandha discovered a type confusion bug in the Indexed DB Manager. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2728">CVE-2015-2728</a>) Holger Fuhrmannek discovered an out-of-bounds read in Web Audio. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2729">CVE-2015-2729</a>) Watson Ladd discovered that NSS incorrectly handled Elliptical Curve Cryptography (ECC) multiplication. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to spoof ECDSA signatures. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2730">CVE-2015-2730</a>) A use-after-free was discovered when a Content Policy modifies the DOM to remove a DOM object. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2731">CVE-2015-2731</a>) Ronald Crane discovered multiple security vulnerabilities. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2734">CVE-2015-2734</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2735">CVE-2015-2735</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2736">CVE-2015-2736</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2737">CVE-2015-2737</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2738">CVE-2015-2738</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2739">CVE-2015-2739</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2740">CVE-2015-2740</a>) David Keeler discovered that key pinning checks can be skipped when an overridable certificate error occurs. This allows a user to manually override an error for a fake certificate, but cannot be exploited on its own. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2741">CVE-2015-2741</a>) Jonas Jenwald discovered that some internal workers were incorrectly executed with a high privilege. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this in combination with another security vulnerability, to execute arbitrary code in a privileged scope. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2743">CVE-2015-2743</a>) Matthew Green discovered a DHE key processing issue in NSS where a MITM could force a server to downgrade TLS connections to 512-bit export-grade cryptography. An attacker could potentially exploit this to impersonate the server. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-4000)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox) <span> [39.0+build5-0ubuntu0.12.04.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox/39.0+build5-0ubuntu0.12.04.2) </span>
