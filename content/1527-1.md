    It was discovered that Expat computed hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably. If a user or application linked against Expat were tricked into opening a crafted XML file, an attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive CPU resources.

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 11.10
* Ubuntu 11.04
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Summary

Expat could be made to cause a denial of service by consuming excessive CPU and memory resources.

### Software description

* expat 

### Details

It was discovered that Expat computed hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably. If a user or application linked against Expat were tricked into opening a crafted XML file, an attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive CPU resources. ([CVE-2012-0876](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0876))

Tim Boddy discovered that Expat did not properly handle memory reallocation when processing XML files. If a user or application linked against Expat were tricked into opening a crafted XML file, an attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive memory resources. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, 10.04 LTS, 11.04 and 11.10. ([CVE-2012-1148](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1148))
