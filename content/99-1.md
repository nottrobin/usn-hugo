### php4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Stefano Di Paola discovered integer overflows in PHP&#39;s pack() and unpack() functions. A malicious PHP script could exploit these to break out of safe mode and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the PHP interpreter. (CAN-2004-1018)

Note: The second part of CAN-2004-1018 (buffer overflow in the shmop_write() function) was already fixed in USN-66-1.

Stefan Esser discovered two safe mode bypasses which allowed malicious PHP scripts to circumvent path restrictions. This was possible by either using virtual_popen() with a current directory containing shell metacharacters (CAN-2004-1063) or creating a specially crafted directory whose length exceeded the capacity of the realpath() function (CAN-2004-1064).

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 4.10
 : libapache2-mod-php4 
 : php4-cgi 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).
