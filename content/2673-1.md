    Karthikeyan Bhargavan discovered that NSS incorrectly handled state transitions for the TLS state machine. If a remote attacker were able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to skip the ServerKeyExchange message and remove the forward-secrecy property.

### Details

Karthikeyan Bhargavan discovered that NSS incorrectly handled state transitions for the TLS state machine. If a remote attacker were able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to skip the ServerKeyExchange message and remove the forward-secrecy property. ([CVE-2015-2721](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2721))

Bob Clary, Christian Holler, Bobby Holley, and Andrew McCreight discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2015-2724](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2724))

Ronald Crane discovered multiple security vulnerabilities. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2015-2740](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2734">CVE-2015-2734</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2735">CVE-2015-2735</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2736">CVE-2015-2736</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2737">CVE-2015-2737</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2738">CVE-2015-2738</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2739">CVE-2015-2739</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2740))

Matthew Green discovered a DHE key processing issue in NSS where a MITM could force a server to downgrade TLS connections to 512-bit export-grade cryptography. An attacker could potentially exploit this to impersonate the server. ([CVE-2015-4000](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-4000))
