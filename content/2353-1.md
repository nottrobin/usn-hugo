### apt vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

APT could be made to crash or run programs if it received specially crafted network traffic.

### Software description

* apt 

### Details

It was discovered that APT incorrectly handled certain http URLs. If a remote attacker were able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to cause APT to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. The default compiler options for affected releases should reduce the vulnerability to a denial of service. ([CVE-2014-6273](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-6273))

In addition, this update fixes regressions introduced by the USN-2348-1 security update: APT incorrectly handled file:/// sources on a different partition, incorrectly handled Dir::state::lists set to a relative path, and incorrectly handled cdrom: sources. 

### Update instructions

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
