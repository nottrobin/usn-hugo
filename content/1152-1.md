### libvirt vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.04
* Ubuntu 10.10
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Libvirt could be made to crash or read arbitrary files on the host. 

### Software description

* libvirt 

### Details

It was discovered that libvirt did not use thread-safe error reporting. A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash. ([CVE-2011-1486](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1486))

Eric Blake discovered that libvirt had an off-by-one error which could be used to reopen disk probing and bypass the fix for [CVE-2011-2178](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2238">CVE-2010-2238</a>. A privileged attacker in the guest could exploit this to read arbitrary files on the host. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04. By default, guests are confined by an AppArmor profile which provided partial protection against this flaw. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2178))
