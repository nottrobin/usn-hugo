description: The sscanf() function did not properly check array boundaries. In applications
  which use sscanf() with argument swapping, a remote attacker could potentially exploit
  this to crash the affected web application or even execute arbitrary code with the
  application&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2006-4020](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4020))
releases:
- ubuntu-05.04

### php4, php5 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04

### Details

The sscanf() function did not properly check array boundaries. In applications which use sscanf() with argument swapping, a remote attacker could potentially exploit this to crash the affected web application or even execute arbitrary code with the application&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2006-4020](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4020))

The file_exists() and imap_reopen() functions did not perform proper open_basedir and safe_mode checks which could allow local scripts to bypass intended restrictions. ([CVE-2006-4481](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4481))

On 64 bit systems the str_repeat() and wordwrap() functions did not properly check buffer boundaries. Depending on the application, this could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the applications&#39; privileges. This only affects the amd64 and sparc platforms. ([CVE-2006-4482](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4482))

A buffer overflow was discovered in the LWZReadByte_() function of the GIF image file parser. By tricking a PHP application into processing a specially crafted GIF image, a remote attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the application&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2006-4484](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4484))
