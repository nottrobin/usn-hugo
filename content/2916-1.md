* perl 

### Details

It was discovered that Perl incorrectly handled certain regular expressions with an invalid backreference. An attacker could use this issue to cause Perl to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2013-7422](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-7422))

Markus Vervier discovered that Perl incorrectly handled nesting in the Data::Dumper module. An attacker could use this issue to cause Perl to consume memory and crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2014-4330](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-4330))

Stephane Chazelas discovered that Perl incorrectly handled duplicate environment variables. An attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass the taint protection mechanism. ([CVE-2016-2381](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2381))
