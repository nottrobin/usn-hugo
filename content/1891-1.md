    Multiple memory safety issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.

### thunderbird vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 13.04
* Ubuntu 12.10
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird. 

### Software description

* thunderbird 

### Details

Multiple memory safety issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-1682](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1682))

Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free bugs. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could possibly exploit these to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-1686](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1684">CVE-2013-1684</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1685">CVE-2013-1685</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1686))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that user defined code within the XBL scope of an element could be made to bypass System Only Wrappers (SOW). If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-1687](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1687))

A crash was discovered when reloading a page that contained content using the onreadystatechange event. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-1690](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1690))

Johnathan Kuskos discovered that Thunderbird sent data in the body of XMLHttpRequest HEAD requests. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could exploit this to conduct Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. ([CVE-2013-1692](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1692))

Paul Stone discovered a timing flaw in the processing of SVG images with filters. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could exploit this to view sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-1693](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1693))

Boris Zbarsky discovered a flaw in PreserveWrapper. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-1694](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1694))

It was discovered that XrayWrappers could be bypassed to call content-defined methods in certain circumstances. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could exploit this to cause undefined behaviour. ([CVE-2013-1697](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1697)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:
