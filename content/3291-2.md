### linux-aws, linux-gke, linux-raspi2, linux-snapdragon vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-aws 

* linux-gke 

* linux-raspi2 

* linux-snapdragon 

### Details

USN-3291-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the generic Linux kernel. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux kernel built for specific processors and cloud environments.

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the generic SCSI (sg) subsystem in the Linux kernel contained a stack-based buffer overflow. A local attacker with access to an sg device could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-7187](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-7187))

It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference existed in the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) driver for VMWare devices in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2017-7261](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-7261))

Li Qiang discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) driver for VMWare devices in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-7294](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-7294))

It was discovered that an information leak existed in the set_mempolicy and mbind compat syscalls in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2017-7616](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-7616)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
 : linux-image-gke <span>4.4.0.1013.15</span>
 : [linux-image-4.4.0-1013-gke](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-gke) <span> [4.4.0-1013.13](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-gke/4.4.0-1013.13) </span> 
 : [linux-image-4.4.0-1017-aws](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-aws) <span> [4.4.0-1017.26](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-aws/4.4.0-1017.26) </span> 
 : [linux-image-4.4.0-1058-snapdragon](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-snapdragon) <span> [4.4.0-1058.62](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-snapdragon/4.4.0-1058.62) </span> 
 : linux-image-snapdragon <span>4.4.0.1058.51</span>
 : linux-image-aws <span>4.4.0.1017.20</span>
 : [linux-image-4.4.0-1055-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-raspi2) <span> [4.4.0-1055.62](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-raspi2/4.4.0-1055.62) </span> 
 : linux-image-raspi2 <span>4.4.0.1055.56</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
