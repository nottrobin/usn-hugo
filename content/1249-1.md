title: "USN-1249-1: BackupPC vulnerabilities"
series: [ ubuntu-08.04-lts]
date: 2011-10-27 12:00:00
description: |
    It was discovered that BackupPC did not properly sanitize its input when processing backup browser error messages, resulting in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing server output during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain. This issue did not affect Ubuntu 11.10. ([CVE-2011-3361](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3361))
