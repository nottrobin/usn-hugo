    Christian Holler, David Keeler and Byron Campen discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.

### thunderbird vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird. 

### Software description

* thunderbird 

### Details

Christian Holler, David Keeler and Byron Campen discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1547](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1547))

Atte Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow when interacting with WebAudio buffers. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1549](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1549))

Atte Kettunen discovered a use-after-free in WebAudio. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1550](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1550))

Jethro Beekman discovered a use-after-free when the FireOnStateChange event is triggered in some circumstances. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1555](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1555))

Patrick Cozzi discovered a crash when using the Cesium JS library to generate WebGL content. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privilges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1556](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1556))

Tyson Smith and Jesse Schwartzentruber discovered a use-after-free in CERT_DestroyCertificate. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1544](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1544))

A crash was discovered in Skia when scaling an image, if the scaling operation takes too long. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1557](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1557))

Christian Holler discovered several issues when parsing certificates with non-standard character encoding, resulting in the inability to use valid SSL certificates in some circumstances. ([CVE-2014-1560](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1558">CVE-2014-1558</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1559">CVE-2014-1559</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1560))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that network redirects could cause an iframe to escape the confinements defined by its sandbox attribute in some circumstances. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting attacks. ([CVE-2014-1552](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1552))
