### mozilla-thunderbird, thunderbird vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 7.10
* Ubuntu 7.04
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* mozilla-thunderbird 

* thunderbird 

### Details

It was discovered that the same-origin check in Thunderbird could be bypassed. If a user had JavaScript enabled and were tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker may be able to execute JavaScript in the context of a different website. ([CVE-2008-3835](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3835))

Several problems were discovered in the browser engine of Thunderbird. If a user had JavaScript enabled, this could allow an attacker to execute code with chrome privileges. ([CVE-2008-4060](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4058">CVE-2008-4058</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4059">CVE-2008-4059</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4060))

Drew Yao, David Maciejak and other Mozilla developers found several problems in the browser engine of Thunderbird. If a user had JavaScript enabled and were tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-4064](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4061">CVE-2008-4061</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4062">CVE-2008-4062</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4063">CVE-2008-4063</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4064))

Dave Reed discovered a flaw in the JavaScript parsing code when processing certain BOM characters. An attacker could exploit this to bypass script filters and perform cross-site scripting attacks if a user had JavaScript enabled. ([CVE-2008-4065](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4065))

Gareth Heyes discovered a flaw in the HTML parser of Thunderbird. If a user had JavaScript enabled and were tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could bypass script filtering and perform cross-site scripting attacks. ([CVE-2008-4066](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4066))

Boris Zbarsky and Georgi Guninski independently discovered flaws in the resource: protocol. An attacker could exploit this to perform directory traversal, read information about the system, and prompt the user to save information in a file. ([CVE-2008-4068](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4067">CVE-2008-4067</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4068))

Georgi Guninski discovered that Thunderbird improperly handled cancelled newsgroup messages. If a user opened a crafted newsgroup message, an attacker could cause a buffer overrun and potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-4070](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4070))
