### firefox, firefox-3.0, xulrunner-1.9 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 7.10
* Ubuntu 7.04

### Software description

* firefox 

* firefox-3.0 

* xulrunner-1.9 

### Details

Justin Schuh, Tom Cross and Peter Williams discovered errors in the Firefox URL parsing routines. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted hyperlink, an attacker could overflow a stack buffer and execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2008-0016](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0016))

It was discovered that the same-origin check in Firefox could be bypassed. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website, an attacker may be able to execute JavaScript in the context of a different website. ([CVE-2008-3835](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3835))

Several problems were discovered in the JavaScript engine. This could allow an attacker to execute scripts from page content with chrome privileges. ([CVE-2008-3836](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3836))

Paul Nickerson discovered Firefox did not properly process mouse click events. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could move the content window, which could potentially be used to force a user to perform unintended drag and drop operations. ([CVE-2008-3837](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3837))

Several problems were discovered in the browser engine. This could allow an attacker to execute code with chrome privileges. ([CVE-2008-4060](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4058">CVE-2008-4058</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4059">CVE-2008-4059</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4060))

Drew Yao, David Maciejak and other Mozilla developers found several problems in the browser engine of Firefox. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-4064](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4061">CVE-2008-4061</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4062">CVE-2008-4062</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4063">CVE-2008-4063</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4064))

Dave Reed discovered a flaw in the JavaScript parsing code when processing certain BOM characters. An attacker could exploit this to bypass script filters and perform cross-site scripting attacks. ([CVE-2008-4065](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4065))

Gareth Heyes discovered a flaw in the HTML parser of Firefox. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could bypass script filtering and perform cross-site scripting attacks. ([CVE-2008-4066](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4066))

Boris Zbarsky and Georgi Guninski independently discovered flaws in the resource: protocol. An attacker could exploit this to perform directory traversal, read information about the system, and prompt the user to save information in a file. ([CVE-2008-4068](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4067">CVE-2008-4067</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4068))

Billy Hoffman discovered a problem in the XBM decoder. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious web page or XBM file, an attacker may be able to cause a denial of service via application crash. ([CVE-2008-4069](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4069)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
 : [firefox-3.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox-3.0) <span> [3.0.2+build6+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox-3.0/3.0.2+build6+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.1) </span> 
 : [xulrunner-1.9](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xulrunner-1.9) <span> [1.9.0.2+build6+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xulrunner-1.9/1.9.0.2+build6+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 7.10
 : [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox) <span> [2.0.0.17+1nobinonly-0ubuntu0.7.10](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox/2.0.0.17+1nobinonly-0ubuntu0.7.10) </span> 

Ubuntu 7.04
 : [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox) <span> [2.0.0.17+0nobinonly-0ubuntu0.7.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox/2.0.0.17+0nobinonly-0ubuntu0.7.4) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Firefox and any applications that use xulrunner, such as Epiphany, to effect the necessary changes.
