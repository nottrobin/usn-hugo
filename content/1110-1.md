    It was discovered that KDE KSSL did not properly verify X.509 certificates when the certificate was issued for an IP address. An attacker could exploit this to perform a man in the middle attack to view sensitive information or alter encrypted communications.

### kde4libs vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.10
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 9.10

### Summary

An attacker could send crafted input to Konqueror to view sensitive information.

### Software description

* kde4libs 

### Details

It was discovered that KDE KSSL did not properly verify X.509 certificates when the certificate was issued for an IP address. An attacker could exploit this to perform a man in the middle attack to view sensitive information or alter encrypted communications. ([CVE-2011-1094](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1094))

Tim Brown discovered that KDE KHTML did not properly escape URLs from externally generated error pages. An attacker could expoit this to conduct cross-site scripting attacks. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing server output during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data (such as passwords), within the same domain. ([CVE-2011-1168](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1168))
