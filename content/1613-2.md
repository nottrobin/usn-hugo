### python2.4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Python 2.4. 

### Software description

* python2.4 

### Details

USN-1613-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Python 2.5. This update provides the corresponding updates for Python 2.4.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that Python would prepend an empty string to sys.path under certain circumstances. A local attacker with write access to the current working directory could exploit this to execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2012-1148](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5983">CVE-2008-5983</a>) It was discovered that the audioop module did not correctly perform input validation. If a user or automatated system were tricked into opening a crafted audio file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1634">CVE-2010-1634</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2089">CVE-2010-2089</a>) Giampaolo Rodola discovered several race conditions in the smtpd module. A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via daemon outage. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-3493">CVE-2010-3493</a>) It was discovered that the CGIHTTPServer module did not properly perform input validation on certain HTTP GET requests. A remote attacker could potentially obtain access to CGI script source files. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1015">CVE-2011-1015</a>) Niels Heinen discovered that the urllib and urllib2 modules would process Location headers that specify a redirection to file: URLs. A remote attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information or cause a denial of service. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1521">CVE-2011-1521</a>) It was discovered that SimpleHTTPServer did not use a charset parameter in the Content-Type HTTP header. An attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against Internet Explorer 7 users. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4940">CVE-2011-4940</a>) It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4944">CVE-2011-4944</a>) It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0845">CVE-2012-0845</a>) It was discovered that the Expat module in Python 2.5 computed hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably. If a user or application using pyexpat were tricked into opening a crafted XML file, an attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive CPU resources. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0876">CVE-2012-0876</a>) Tim Boddy discovered that the Expat module in Python 2.5 did not properly handle memory reallocation when processing XML files. If a user or application using pyexpat were tricked into opening a crafted XML file, an attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive memory resources.
