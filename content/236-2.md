### kdegraphics, koffice vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04

### Details

USN-236-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in xpdf. kpdf and kword contain copies of xpdf code and are thus vulnerable to the same issues.

For reference, this is the original advisory:

 Chris Evans discovered several integer overflows in the XPDF code, which is present in xpdf, the Poppler library, and tetex-bin. By tricking an user into opening a specially crafted PDF file, an attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application that processes the document.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 5.10
 : kpdf 
 : kword 

Ubuntu 5.04
 : kpdf 
 : kword 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).
