    USN-99-1 fixed a safe mode bypass which allowed malicious PHP scripts to circumvent path restrictions by creating a specially crafted directory whose length exceeded the capacity of the realpath() function (CAN-2004-1064). However, this caused severe regressions, some applications like SquirrelMail and Gallery did not work any more, and the package &#39;php4-pear&#39; was empty. The current version repairs this.

### php4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

USN-99-1 fixed a safe mode bypass which allowed malicious PHP scripts to circumvent path restrictions by creating a specially crafted directory whose length exceeded the capacity of the realpath() function (CAN-2004-1064). However, this caused severe regressions, some applications like SquirrelMail and Gallery did not work any more, and the package &#39;php4-pear&#39; was empty. The current version repairs this.

In addition this update fixes a crash of the PHP interpreter if curl_init() was called with a non-string argument. Please note that this is not security relevant since this condition usually cannot be triggered externally.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 4.10
 : libapache2-mod-php4 
 : php4-cgi 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

None
