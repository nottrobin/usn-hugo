### mysql-dfsg-5.0 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Details

Dmitri Lenev discovered that arguments of setuid SQL functions were evaluated in the security context of the functions&#39; definer instead of its caller. An authenticated user with the privilege to call such a function could exploit this to execute arbitrary statements with the privileges of the definer of that function. ([CVE-2006-4227](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4227))

Peter Gulutzan reported a potentially confusing situation of the MERGE table engine. If an user creates a merge table, and the administrator later revokes privileges on the original table only (without changing the privileges on the merge table), that user still has access to the data by using the merge table. This is intended behaviour, but might be undesirable in some installations; this update introduces a new server option &quot;--skip-merge&quot; which disables the MERGE engine completely. ([CVE-2006-4031](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4031))

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : mysql-server-5.0 <span>5.0.22-0ubuntu6.06.2</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the necessary changes.
