### php4, php5 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04

### Details

The stripos() function did not check for invalidly long or empty haystack strings. In an application that uses this function on arbitrary untrusted data this could be exploited to crash the PHP interpreter. ([CVE-2006-4485](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4485))

An integer overflow was discovered in the PHP memory allocation handling. On 64-bit platforms, the &quot;memory_limit&quot; setting was not enforced correctly. A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a Denial of Service attack through memory exhaustion. ([CVE-2006-4486](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4486))

Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered that security relevant configuration options like open_basedir and safe_mode (which can be configured in Apache&#39;s httpd.conf) could be bypassed and reset to their default value in php.ini by using the ini_restore() function. ([CVE-2006-4625](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4625))

Stefan Esser discovered that the ecalloc() function in the Zend engine did not check for integer overflows. This particularly affected the unserialize() function. In applications which unserialize untrusted user-defined data, this could be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the application&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2006-4812](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4812))

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:
