### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.10

### Summary

The system could be made to crash under certain conditions. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

 Dmitry Monakhov reported a race condition flaw the Linux ext4 filesystem that can expose stale data. An unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause an information leak. ([CVE-2012-4508](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4508))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s handling of new hot-plugged memory. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service by crashing the system. ([CVE-2012-5517](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5517))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s /dev/dvb device. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from the kernel&#39;s stack memory. ([CVE-2013-1928](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1928)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.10
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-216-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [3.5.0-216.23](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-216.23) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
