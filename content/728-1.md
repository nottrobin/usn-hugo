    Glenn Randers-Pehrson discovered that the embedded libpng in Firefox did not properly initialize pointers. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website with a crafted PNG file, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

### firefox-3.0, xulrunner-1.9 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Software description

* firefox-3.0 

* xulrunner-1.9 

### Details

Glenn Randers-Pehrson discovered that the embedded libpng in Firefox did not properly initialize pointers. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website with a crafted PNG file, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-0040](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0040))

Martijn Wargers, Jesse Ruderman, Josh Soref, Gary Kwong, and Timothee Groleau discovered flaws in the browser engine. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-0774](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0771">CVE-2009-0771</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0772">CVE-2009-0772</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0773">CVE-2009-0773</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0774))

A flaw was discovered in Firefox&#39;s garbage collection process. Under certain circumstances a remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-0775](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0775))

Georgi Guninski discovered a flaw when Firefox performed a cross-domain redirect. An attacker could bypass the same-origin policy in Firefox by utilizing nsIRDFService and steal private data from users authenticated to the redirected website. ([CVE-2009-0776](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0776))

Masahiro Yamada discovered that Firefox did not display control characters in the location bar. An attacker could exploit this to spoof the location bar, such as in a phishing attack. ([CVE-2009-0777](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0777))
