([CVE-2011-1574](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1574))

It was discovered that libmodplug did not correctly handle certain malformed ABC media files. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted ABC file, an attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2011-1761](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1761))

The default compiler options for affected releases should reduce the vulnerability to a denial of service.
