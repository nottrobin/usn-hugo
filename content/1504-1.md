    It was discovered that Qt did not properly handle wildcard domain names or IP addresses in the Common Name field of X.509 certificates. An attacker could exploit this to perform a man in the middle attack to view sensitive information or alter encrypted communications. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS.

### qt4-x11 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.04
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Qt Applications could be made to crash or run programs as your login if they opened specially crafted files.

### Software description

* qt4-x11 

### Details

It was discovered that Qt did not properly handle wildcard domain names or IP addresses in the Common Name field of X.509 certificates. An attacker could exploit this to perform a man in the middle attack to view sensitive information or alter encrypted communications. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. ([CVE-2010-5076](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-5076))

A heap-based buffer overflow was discovered in the HarfBuzz module. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted font file in a Qt application, an attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2011-3193](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3193))

It was discovered that Qt did not properly handle greyscale TIFF images. If a Qt application could be made to process a crafted TIFF file, an attacker could cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-3194](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3194))
