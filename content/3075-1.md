### imlib2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Imlib2. 

### Software description

* imlib2 

### Details

Jakub Wilk discovered an out of bounds read in the GIF loader implementation in Imlib2. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-3994](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-3994))

Yuriy M. Kaminskiy discovered an off-by-one error when handling coordinates in Imlib2. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash). ([CVE-2016-3993](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-3993))

Yuriy M. Kaminskiy discovered that integer overflows existed in Imlib2 when handling images with large dimensions. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion or application crash). ([CVE-2016-4024](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-9771">CVE-2014-9771</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4024))

Kevin Ryde discovered that the ellipse drawing code in Imlib2 would attempt to divide by zero when drawing a 2x1 ellipse. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash). ([CVE-2011-5326](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-5326))

It was discovered that Imlib2 did not properly handled GIF images without colormaps. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash). This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-9762](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-9762))

It was discovered that Imlib2 did not properly handle some PNM images, leading to a division by zero. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash). This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-9763](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-9763))

It was discovered that Imlib2 did not properly handle error conditions when loading some GIF images. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash). This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-9764](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-9764)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
 : [libimlib2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/imlib2) <span> [1.4.7-1ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/imlib2/1.4.7-1ubuntu0.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 : [libimlib2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/imlib2) <span> [1.4.6-2ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/imlib2/1.4.6-2ubuntu0.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [libimlib2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/imlib2) <span> [1.4.4-1ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/imlib2/1.4.4-1ubuntu0.1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you will need to restart applications that make use of Imlib2 to make all the necessary changes.
