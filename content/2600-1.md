### linux vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.10

### Summary

The system could be made to run programs as an administrator. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

A race condition between chown() and execve() was discovered in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could exploit this race by using chown on a setuid-user-binary to gain administrative privileges. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 14.10
 : [linux-image-3.16.0-37-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.16.0-37.49](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.16.0-37.49) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.16.0-37-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.16.0-37.49](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.16.0-37.49) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.16.0-37-powerpc64-emb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.16.0-37.49](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.16.0-37.49) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.16.0-37-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.16.0-37.49](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.16.0-37.49) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.16.0-37-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.16.0-37.49](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.16.0-37.49) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.16.0-37-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.16.0-37.49](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.16.0-37.49) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.16.0-37-powerpc-e500mc](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.16.0-37.49](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.16.0-37.49) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
