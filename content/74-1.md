title: "USN-74-1: Postfix vulnerability"
releases: [ ubuntu-04.10 ]
date: 2005-02-04 12:00:00
description: |
    Jean-Samuel Reynaud noticed a programming error in the IPv6 handling code of Postfix when /proc/net/if_inet6 is not available (which is the case in Ubuntu since Postfix runs in a chroot). If &quot;permit_mx_backup&quot; was enabled in the &quot;smtpd_recipient_restrictions&quot;, Postfix turned into an open relay, i. e. erroneously permitted the delivery of arbitrary mail to any MX host which has an IPv6 address.
