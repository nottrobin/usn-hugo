### neutron vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 13.10

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in OpenStack Neutron. 

### Software description

* neutron 

### Details

Darragh O&#39;Reilly discovered that the Ubuntu packaging for OpenStack Neutron did not properly set up its sudo configuration. If a different flaw was found in OpenStack Neutron, this vulnerability could be used to escalate privileges. ([CVE-2013-6433](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-6433))

Stephen Ma and Christoph Thiel discovered that the openvswitch-agent in OpenStack Neutron did not properly perform input validation when creating security group rules when specifying --remote-ip-prefix. A remote authenticated attacker could exploit this to prevent application of additional rules. ([CVE-2014-0187](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-0187))

Thiago Martins discovered that OpenStack Neutron would inappropriately apply SNAT rules to IPv6 subnets when using the L3-agent. A remote authenticated attacker could exploit this to prevent floating IPv4 addresses from being attached throughout the cloud. ([CVE-2014-4167](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-4167))
