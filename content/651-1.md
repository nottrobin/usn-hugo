### ruby1.8 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 7.10
* Ubuntu 7.04
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* ruby1.8 

### Details

Akira Tagoh discovered a vulnerability in Ruby which lead to an integer overflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into running a malicious script, an attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-2376](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2376))

Laurent Gaffie discovered that Ruby did not properly check for memory allocation failures. If a user or automated system were tricked into running a malicious script, an attacker could cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-3443](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3443))

Keita Yamaguchi discovered several safe level vulnerabilities in Ruby. An attacker could use this to bypass intended access restrictions. ([CVE-2008-3655](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3655))

Keita Yamaguchi discovered that WEBrick in Ruby did not properly validate paths ending with &quot;.&quot;. A remote attacker could send a crafted HTTP request and cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-3656](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3656))

Keita Yamaguchi discovered that the dl module in Ruby did not check the taintness of inputs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass safe levels and execute dangerous functions. ([CVE-2008-3657](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3657))

Luka Treiber and Mitja Kolsek discovered that REXML in Ruby did not always use expansion limits when processing XML documents. If a user or automated system were tricked into open a crafted XML file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via CPU consumption. ([CVE-2008-3790](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3790))

Jan Lieskovsky discovered several flaws in the name resolver of Ruby. A remote attacker could exploit this to spoof DNS entries, which could lead to misdirected traffic. This is a different vulnerability from [CVE-2008-3905](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-1447">CVE-2008-1447</a>. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3905))
