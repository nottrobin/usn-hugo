description: |
    A Denial of Service vulnerability was discovered in the GNU TLS library, which provides common cryptographic algorithms and is used by many applications in Ubuntu. Due to a missing sanity check of the padding length field, specially crafted ciphertext blocks caused an out of bounds memory access which could crash the application. It was not possible to exploit this to execute any attacker specified code.
