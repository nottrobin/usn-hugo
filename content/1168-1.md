### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Multiple kernel flaws have been fixed. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

 Timo Warns discovered that the LDM disk partition handling code did not correctly handle certain values. By inserting a specially crafted disk device, a local attacker could exploit this to gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-1017](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1017))

Neil Horman discovered that NFSv4 did not correctly handle certain orders of operation with ACL data. A remote attacker with access to an NFSv4 mount could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1090](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1090))

Timo Warns discovered that OSF partition parsing routines did not correctly clear memory. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted block device to read kernel memory, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2011-1163](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1163))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that MPT devices did not correctly validate certain values in ioctl calls. If these drivers were loaded, a local attacker could exploit this to read arbitrary kernel memory, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2011-1495](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1494">CVE-2011-1494</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1495))

Tavis Ormandy discovered that the pidmap function did not correctly handle large requests. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1593](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1593))

Oliver Hartkopp and Dave Jones discovered that the CAN network driver did not correctly validate certain socket structures. If this driver was loaded, a local attacker could crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1748](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1598">CVE-2011-1598</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1748))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the AGP driver did not check certain ioctl values. A local attacker with access to the video subsystem could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service, or possibly gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-2022](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1745">CVE-2011-1745</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2022))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the AGP driver did not check the size of certain memory allocations. A local attacker with access to the video subsystem could exploit this to run the system out of memory, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1746](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1746))

Dan Rosenberg reported an error in the old ABI compatibility layer of ARM kernels. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service or gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-1759](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1759))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the DCCP stack did not correctly handle certain packet structures. A remote attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1770](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1770))

Timo Warns discovered that the EFI GUID partition table was not correctly parsed. A physically local attacker that could insert mountable devices could exploit this to crash the system or possibly gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-1776](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1776))

Yogesh Sharma discovered that CIFS did not correctly handle UNCs that had no prefixpaths. A local attacker with access to a CIFS partition could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-3363](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3363))

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
