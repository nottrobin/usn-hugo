description: |
    A flaw was discovered in MoinMoin&#39;s debug reporting sanitizer which  could lead to a cross-site scripting attack.  By tricking a user into  viewing a crafted MoinMoin URL, an attacker could execute arbitrary  JavaScript as the current MoinMoin user, possibly exposing the user&#39;s  authentication information for the domain where MoinMoin was hosted. Only Ubuntu Breezy was vulnerable.  ([CVE-2007-0901](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0901))

### Details

A flaw was discovered in MoinMoin&#39;s debug reporting sanitizer which could lead to a cross-site scripting attack. By tricking a user into viewing a crafted MoinMoin URL, an attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript as the current MoinMoin user, possibly exposing the user&#39;s authentication information for the domain where MoinMoin was hosted. Only Ubuntu Breezy was vulnerable. ([CVE-2007-0901](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0901))

An information leak was discovered in MoinMoin&#39;s debug reporting, which could expose information about the versions of software running on the host system. MoinMoin administrators can add &quot;show_traceback=0&quot; to their site configurations to disable debug tracebacks. ([CVE-2007-0902](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0902))
