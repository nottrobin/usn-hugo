### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.10

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

A failure to validate input was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s Xen netback (network backend) driver. A user in a guest OS may exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service to the guest OS and other guest domains. ([CVE-2013-0216](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0216))

A memory leak was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s Xen netback (network backend) driver. A user in a guest OS could trigger this flaw to cause a denial of service on the system. ([CVE-2013-0217](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0217))

Andrew Jones discovered a flaw with the xen_iret function in Linux kernel&#39;s Xen virtualizeation. In the 32-bit Xen paravirt platform an unprivileged guest OS user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash the system) or gain guest OS privilege. ([CVE-2013-0228](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0228))

A flaw was reported in the permission checks done by the Linux kernel for /dev/cpu/*/msr. A local root user with all capabilities dropped could exploit this flaw to execute code with full root capabilities. ([CVE-2013-0268](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0268))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s vhost driver used to accelerate guest networking in KVM based virtual machines. A privileged guest user could exploit this flaw to crash the host system. ([CVE-2013-0311](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0311))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s Bluetooth stack when HIDP (Human Interface Device Protocol) support is enabled. A local unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause an information leak from the kernel. ([CVE-2013-0349](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0349))

A flaw was discovered on the Linux kernel&#39;s VFAT filesystem driver when a disk is mounted with the utf8 option (this is the default on Ubuntu). On a system where disks/images can be auto-mounted or a FAT filesystem is mounted an unprivileged user can exploit the flaw to gain root privileges. ([CVE-2013-1773](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1773)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 11.10
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-32-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.0.0-32.50](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.0.0-32.50) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-32-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.0.0-32.50](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.0.0-32.50) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-32-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.0.0-32.50](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.0.0-32.50) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-32-server](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.0.0-32.50](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.0.0-32.50) </span>

 : [linux-image-3.0.0-32-powerpc](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.0.0-32.50](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.0.0-32.50) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-32-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.0.0-32.50](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.0.0-32.50) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
