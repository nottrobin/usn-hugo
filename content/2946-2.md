### linux-lts-trusty vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-trusty 

### Details

Venkatesh Pottem discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel&#39;s CXGB3 driver. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-8812](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8812))

Xiaofei Rex Guo discovered a timing side channel vulnerability in the Linux Extended Verification Module (EVM). An attacker could use this to affect system integrity. ([CVE-2016-2085](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2085))

David Herrmann discovered that the Linux kernel incorrectly accounted file descriptors to the original opener for in-flight file descriptors sent over a unix domain socket. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion). ([CVE-2016-2550](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2550))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel did not enforce limits on the amount of data allocated to buffer pipes. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (resource exhaustion). ([CVE-2016-2847](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2847)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-85-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty) <span> [3.13.0-85.129~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-85.129~precise1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-85-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty) <span> [3.13.0-85.129~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-85.129~precise1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
