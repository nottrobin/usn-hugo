    Multiple memory safety issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 13.10
* Ubuntu 13.04
* Ubuntu 12.10
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird. 

### Software description

* thunderbird 

### Details

Multiple memory safety issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-5591](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1739">CVE-2013-1739</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5590">CVE-2013-5590</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5591))

Jordi Chancel discovered that HTML select elements could display arbitrary content. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct URL spoofing or clickjacking attacks. ([CVE-2013-5593](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5593))

Abhishek Arya discovered a crash when processing XSLT data in some circumstances. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-5604](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5604))

Dan Gohman discovered a flaw in the Javascript engine. If a user had enabled scripting, when combined with other vulnerabilities an attacker could possibly exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-5595](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5595))

Ezra Pool discovered a crash on extremely large pages. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-5596](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5596))

Byoungyoung Lee discovered a use-after-free when updating the offline cache. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-5597](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5597))

Multiple use-after-free flaws were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-5601](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5599">CVE-2013-5599</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5600">CVE-2013-5600</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5601))

A memory corruption flaw was discovered in the Javascript engine when using workers with direct proxies. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-5602](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5602))

Abhishek Arya discovered a use-after-free when interacting with HTML document templates. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-5603](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5603))
