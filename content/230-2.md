### xine-lib vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04
* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

USN-230-1 fixed a vulnerability in the ffmpeg library. The Xine library contains a copy of the ffmpeg code, thus it is vulnerable to the same flaw.

For reference, this is the original advisory:

 Simon Kilvington discovered a buffer overflow in the avcodec_default_get_buffer() function of the ffmpeg library. By tricking an user into opening a malicious movie which contains specially crafted PNG images, this could be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges.
