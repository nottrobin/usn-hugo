### php5 regression

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 7.10

### Software description

* php5 

### Details

USN-549-1 fixed vulnerabilities in PHP. However, some upstream changes were incomplete, which caused crashes in certain situations with Ubuntu 7.10. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that the wordwrap function did not correctly check lengths. Remote attackers could exploit this to cause a crash or monopolize CPU resources, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-3998](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-3998))

 Integer overflows were discovered in the strspn and strcspn functions. Attackers could exploit this to read arbitrary areas of memory, possibly gaining access to sensitive information. ([CVE-2007-4657](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-4657))

 Stanislav Malyshev discovered that money_format function did not correctly handle certain tokens. If a PHP application were tricked into processing a bad format string, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with application privileges. ([CVE-2007-4658](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-4658))

 It was discovered that the php_openssl_make_REQ function did not correctly check buffer lengths. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted message and execute arbitrary code with application privileges. ([CVE-2007-4662](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-4662))

 It was discovered that certain characters in session cookies were not handled correctly. A remote attacker could injection values which could lead to altered application behavior, potentially gaining additional privileges. ([CVE-2007-3799](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-3799))

 Gerhard Wagner discovered that the chunk_split function did not correctly handle long strings. A remote attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with application privileges. ([CVE-2007-4661](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2872">CVE-2007-2872</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-4660">CVE-2007-4660</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-4661))

 Stefan Esser discovered that deeply nested arrays could be made to fill stack space. A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a crash or monopolize CPU resources, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-4670](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-1285">CVE-2007-1285</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-4670))

 Rasmus Lerdorf discovered that the htmlentities and htmlspecialchars functions did not correctly stop when handling partial multibyte sequences. A remote attacker could exploit this to read certain areas of memory, possibly gaining access to sensitive information. ([CVE-2007-5898](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-5898))

 It was discovered that the output_add_rewrite_var fucntion would sometimes leak session id information to forms targeting remote URLs. Malicious remote sites could use this information to gain access to a PHP application user&#39;s login credentials. ([CVE-2007-5899](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-5899)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 7.10
