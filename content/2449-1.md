### ntp vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.10
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in NTP. 

### Software description

* ntp 

### Details

Neel Mehta discovered that NTP generated weak authentication keys. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to brute force the authentication key and send requests if permitted by IP restrictions. ([CVE-2014-9293](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-9293))

Stephen Roettger discovered that NTP generated weak MD5 keys. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to brute force the MD5 key and spoof a client or server. ([CVE-2014-9294](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-9294))

Stephen Roettger discovered that NTP contained buffer overflows in the crypto_recv(), ctl_putdata() and configure() functions. In non-default configurations, a remote attacker could use these issues to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. The default compiler options for affected releases should reduce the vulnerability to a denial of service. In addition, attackers would be isolated by the NTP AppArmor profile. ([CVE-2014-9295](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-9295))

Stephen Roettger discovered that NTP incorrectly continued processing when handling certain errors. ([CVE-2014-9296](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-9296)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 14.10
 : [ntp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ntp) <span> [1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-3ubuntu2.14.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ntp/1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-3ubuntu2.14.10.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 : [ntp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ntp) <span> [1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-3ubuntu2.14.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ntp/1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-3ubuntu2.14.04.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [ntp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ntp) <span> [1:4.2.6.p3+dfsg-1ubuntu3.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ntp/1:4.2.6.p3+dfsg-1ubuntu3.2) </span> 

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [ntp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ntp) <span> [1:4.2.4p8+dfsg-1ubuntu2.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ntp/1:4.2.4p8+dfsg-1ubuntu2.2) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to regenerate any MD5 keys that were manually created with ntp-keygen.
