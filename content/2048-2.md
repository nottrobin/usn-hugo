### curl regression

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.10
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

USN-2048-1 introduced a regression in curl. 

### Software description

* curl 

### Details

USN-2048-1 fixed a vulnerability in curl. The security fix uncovered a bug in the curl command line tool which resulted in the --insecure (-k) option not working as intended. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Scott Cantor discovered that libcurl incorrectly verified CN and SAN name fields when digital signature verification was disabled. When libcurl is being used in this uncommon way by specific applications, an attacker could exploit this to perform a man in the middle attack to view sensitive information or alter encrypted communications. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.10
