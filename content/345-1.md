### mailman vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04

### Details

Steve Alexander discovered that mailman did not properly handle attachments with special filenames. A remote user could exploit that to stop mail delivery until the server administrator manually cleaned these posts. ([CVE-2006-2941](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-2941))

Various cross-site scripting vulnerabilities have been reported by Barry Warsaw. By using specially crafted email addresses, names, and similar arbitrary user-defined strings, a remote attacker could exploit this to run web script code in the list administrator&#39;s web browser. ([CVE-2006-3636](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3636))

URLs logged to the error log file are now checked for invalid characters. Before, specially crafted URLs could inject arbitrary messages into the log.

Ubuntu 5.10
