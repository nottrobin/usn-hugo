### Details

Raphael Geissert discovered that the debdiff.pl tool incorrectly handled shell metacharacters. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted filename, a remote attacher could possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2012-0212](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0212))

Raphael Geissert discovered that the dscverify tool incorrectly escaped arguments to external commands. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing specially crafted files, a remote attacher could possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2012-2240](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2240))

Raphael Geissert discovered that the dget tool incorrectly performed input validation. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing specially crafted files, a remote attacher could delete arbitrary files. ([CVE-2012-2241](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2241))

Raphael Geissert discovered that the dget tool incorrectly escaped arguments to external commands. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing specially crafted files, a remote attacher could possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and Ubuntu 11.04. ([CVE-2012-2242](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2242))

Jim Meyering discovered that the annotate-output tool incorrectly handled temporary files. A local attacker could use this flaw to alter files being processed by the annotate-output tool. On Ubuntu 11.04 and later, this issue was mitigated by the Yama kernel symlink restrictions. ([CVE-2012-3500](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3500))
