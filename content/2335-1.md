### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

An flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s audit subsystem when auditing certain syscalls. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive single-bit values from kernel memory or cause a denial of service (OOPS). ([CVE-2014-3917](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3917))

An information leak was discovered in the rd_mcp backend of the iSCSI target subsystem in the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from ramdisk_mcp memory by leveraging access to a SCSI initiator. ([CVE-2014-4027](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-4027))

Sasha Levin reported an issue with the Linux kernel&#39;s shared memory subsystem when used with range notifications and hole punching. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2014-4171](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-4171))

An information leak was discovered in the control implemenation of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem in the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-4652](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-4652))

A use-after-free flaw was discovered in the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) control implementation of the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2014-4653](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-4653))

A authorization bug was discovered with the snd_ctl_elem_add function of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) in the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit his bug to cause a denial of service (remove kernel controls). ([CVE-2014-4654](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-4654))

A flaw discovered in how the snd_ctl_elem function of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) handled a reference count. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (integer overflow and limit bypass). ([CVE-2014-4655](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-4655))

An integer overflow flaw was discovered in the control implementation of the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA). A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2014-4656](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-4656))

An integer underflow flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s handling of the backlog value for certain SCTP packets. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (socket outage) via a crafted SCTP packet. ([CVE-2014-4667](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-4667))

Jason Gunthorpe reported a flaw with SCTP authentication in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (NULL pointer dereference and OOPS). ([CVE-2014-5077](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-5077)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-1452-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [3.2.0-1452.72](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1452.72) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
