### nss vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 15.10
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

NSS could be made to crash or run programs if it processed specially crafted network traffic.

### Software description

* nss 

### Details

Tyson Smith and Jed Davis discovered that NSS incorrectly handled memory. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause NSS to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.

This update refreshes the NSS package to version 3.23 which includes the latest CA certificate bundle. As a security improvement, this update also modifies NSS behaviour to reject DH key sizes below 1024 bits, preventing a possible downgrade attack. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
