### php4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

FraMe from kernelpanik.org reported that the cURL module does not respect open_basedir restrictions. As a result, scripts which used cURL to open files with an user-specified path could read arbitrary local files outside of the open_basedir directory.

Stefano Di Paola discovered a vulnerability in PHP&#39;s shmop_write() function. Its &quot;offset&quot; parameter was not checked for negative values, which allowed an attacker to write arbitrary data to arbitrary memory locations. A script which passed unchecked parameters to shmop_write() could possibly be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server and to bypass safe mode restrictions.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 4.10
 : libapache2-mod-php4 
 : php4-cgi 
 : php4-curl 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

None
