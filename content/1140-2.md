Original advisory details:

 Marcus Granado discovered that PAM incorrectly handled configuration files with non-ASCII usernames. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service, or possibly obtain login access with a different users username. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2010-4707](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0887">CVE-2009-0887</a>) It was discovered that the PAM pam_xauth, pam_env and pam_mail modules incorrectly handled dropping privileges when performing operations. A local attacker could use this flaw to read certain arbitrary files, and access other sensitive information.

A local attacker could use this flaw to possibly gain privileges. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-3853">CVE-2010-3853</a>) It was discovered that the PAM pam_xauth module incorrectly handled certain failures. A local attacker could use this flaw to delete certain unintended files. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4706">CVE-2010-4706</a>) It was discovered that the PAM pam_xauth module incorrectly verified certain file properties. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4707))
