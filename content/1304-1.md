### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.04

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

A bug was discovered in the XFS filesystem&#39;s handling of pathnames. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service, or gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-4077](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4077))

Nick Bowler discovered the kernel GHASH message digest algorithm incorrectly handled error conditions. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a kernel oops. ([CVE-2011-4081](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4081))

Scot Doyle discovered that the bridge networking interface incorrectly handled certain network packets. A remote attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-4087](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4087))

A flaw was found in the Journaling Block Device (JBD). A local attacker able to mount ext3 or ext4 file systems could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-4132](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4132))

A bug was found in the way headroom check was performed in udp6_ufo_fragment() function. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system. ([CVE-2011-4326](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4326))

Clement Lecigne discovered a bug in the HFS file system bounds checking. When a malformed HFS file system is mounted a local user could crash the system or gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-4330](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4330))
