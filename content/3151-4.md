### linux-raspi2 vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

### Summary

The system could be made to crash or run programs as an administrator. 

### Software description

* linux-raspi2 

### Details

Philip Pettersson discovered a race condition in the af_packet implementation in the Linux kernel. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or run arbitrary code with administrative privileges. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-4.4.0-1034-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-raspi2) <span> [4.4.0-1034.41](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-raspi2/4.4.0-1034.41) </span> 
 : [linux-image-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-raspi2) <span> [4.4.0.1034.33](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-raspi2/4.4.0-1034.41) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
