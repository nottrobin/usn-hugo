### flex vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04
* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Chris Moore discovered a buffer overflow in a particular class of lexicographical scanners generated by flex. This could be exploited to execute arbitrary code by processing specially crafted user-defined input to an application that uses a flex scanner for parsing.

This flaw particularly affects gpc, the GNU Pascal Compiler. A potentially remote attacker could exploit this by tricking an user or automated system into compiling a specially crafted Pascal source code file.

Please note that gpc is not officially supported in Ubuntu (it is in the &#39;universe&#39; component of the archive). However, this affects you if you use a customized version built from the gcc-3.3 or gcc-3.4 source package (which is supported).

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 5.10
 : flex 
 : gpc-2.1-3.4 
 : gpc-2.1-3.3 

Ubuntu 5.04
 : flex 
 : gpc-2.1-3.4 
 : gpc-2.1-3.3 

Ubuntu 4.10
 : flex 
 : gpc-2.1-3.4 
 : gpc-2.1-3.3 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).
