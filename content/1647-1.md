### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.10

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

 Brad Spengler discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s uname system call. An unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to read kernel stack memory. ([CVE-2012-0957](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0957))

Rodrigo Freire discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s TCP illinois congestion control algorithm. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-4565](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4565))

Mathias Krause discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s XFRM netlink interface. A local user with the NET_ADMIN capability could exploit this flaw to leak the contents of kernel memory. ([CVE-2012-6536](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-6536))

Mathias Krause discovered several errors in the Linux kernel&#39;s xfrm_user implementation. A local attacker could exploit these flaws to examine parts of kernel memory. ([CVE-2012-6537](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-6537))

Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel&#39;s xfrm_user copy_to_user_auth function. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine parts of kernel heap memory. ([CVE-2012-6538](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-6538))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernels handling of memory ranges with PROT_NONE when transparent hugepages are in use. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash the system). ([CVE-2013-0309](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0309))

Mathias Krause discovered a flaw in xfrm_user in the Linux kernel. A local attacker with NET_ADMIN capability could potentially exploit this flaw to escalate privileges. ([CVE-2013-1826](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1826)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.10
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-215-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [3.5.0-215.22](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/3.5.0-215.22) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.
