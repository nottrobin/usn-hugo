### squid vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Details

David Duncan Ross Palmer and Henrik Nordstrom discovered that squid incorrectly handled special characters in FTP URLs. Remote users with access to squid could crash the server leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-0247](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0247))

Erick Dantas Rotole and Henrik Nordstrom discovered that squid could end up in an endless loop when exhausted of available external ACL helpers. Remote users with access to squid could cause CPU starvation, possibly leading to a denial of service. This does not affect a default Ubuntu installation, since external ACL helpers must be configured and used. ([CVE-2007-0248](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0248))

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 6.10
 : squid <span>2.6.1-3ubuntu1.2</span>

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : squid <span>2.5.12-4ubuntu2.2</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the necessary changes.
