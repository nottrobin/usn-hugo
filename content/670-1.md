### vm-builder vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 7.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* shadow 

* vm-builder 

### Details

Mathias Gug discovered that vm-builder improperly set the root password when creating virtual machines. An attacker could exploit this to gain root privileges to the virtual machine by using a predictable password.

This vulnerability only affects virtual machines created with vm-builder under Ubuntu 8.10, and does not affect native Ubuntu installations. An update was made to the shadow package to detect vulnerable systems and disable password authentication for the root account. Vulnerable virtual machines which an attacker has access to should be considered compromised, and appropriate actions taken to secure the machine. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 8.10
