    It was discovered that several wiki actions and preference settings in MoinMoin were not protected from cross-site request forgery (CSRF). If an authenticated user were tricked into visiting a malicious website while logged into MoinMoin, a remote attacker could change the user&#39;s configuration or wiki content.

### Details

It was discovered that several wiki actions and preference settings in MoinMoin were not protected from cross-site request forgery (CSRF). If an authenticated user were tricked into visiting a malicious website while logged into MoinMoin, a remote attacker could change the user&#39;s configuration or wiki content. ([CVE-2010-0717](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-0668">CVE-2010-0668</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-0717))

It was discovered that MoinMoin did not properly sanitize its input when processing user preferences. An attacker could enter malicious content which when viewed by a user, could render in unexpected ways. ([CVE-2010-0669](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-0669))
