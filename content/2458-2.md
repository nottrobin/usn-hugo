Original advisory details:

 Christian Holler, Patrick McManus, Christoph Diehl, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Byron Campen, Terrence Cole, and Nils Ohlmeier discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-8642](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8634">CVE-2014-8634</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8635">CVE-2014-8635</a>) Bobby Holley discovered that some DOM objects with certain properties can bypass XrayWrappers in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass security restrictions. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8636">CVE-2014-8636</a>) Michal Zalewski discovered a use of uninitialized memory when rendering malformed bitmap images on a canvas element. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to steal confidential information. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8637">CVE-2014-8637</a>) Muneaki Nishimura discovered that requests from navigator.sendBeacon() lack an origin header. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site request forgery (XSRF) attacks. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8638">CVE-2014-8638</a>) Xiaofeng Zheng discovered that a web proxy returning a 407 response could inject cookies in to the originally requested domain. If a user connected to a malicious web proxy, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct session-fixation attacks. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8639">CVE-2014-8639</a>) Holger Fuhrmannek discovered a crash in Web Audio while manipulating timelines. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8640">CVE-2014-8640</a>) Mitchell Harper discovered a use-after-free in WebRTC. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8641">CVE-2014-8641</a>) Brian Smith discovered that OCSP responses would fail to verify if signed by a delegated OCSP responder certificate with the id-pkix-ocsp-nocheck extension, potentially allowing a user to connect to a site with a revoked certificate.
