### python3.1 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.04
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Python 3.1. 

### Software description

* python3.1 

### Details

It was discovered that Python would prepend an empty string to sys.path under certain circumstances. A local attacker with write access to the current working directory could exploit this to execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. ([CVE-2008-5983](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5983))

It was discovered that the audioop module did not correctly perform input validation. If a user or automatated system were tricked into opening a crafted audio file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash. These issues only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. ([CVE-2010-2089](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1634">CVE-2010-1634</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2089))

It was discovered that Python distutils contained a race condition when creating the ~/.pypirc file. A local attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2011-4944](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4944))

It was discovered that SimpleXMLRPCServer did not properly validate its input when handling HTTP POST requests. A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via excessive CPU utilization. ([CVE-2012-0845](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0845))

It was discovered that Python was susceptible to hash algorithm attacks. An attacker could cause a denial of service under certian circumstances. This update adds the &#39;-R&#39; command line option and honors setting the PYTHONHASHSEED environment variable to &#39;random&#39; to salt str and datetime objects with an unpredictable value. ([CVE-2012-1150](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1150))

Serhiy Storchaka discovered that the UTF16 decoder in Python did not properly reset internal variables after error handling. An attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via memory corruption. ([CVE-2012-2135](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2135)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:
