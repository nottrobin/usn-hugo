    Kees Cook discovered that some shadow utilities did not correctly validate user input. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to inject newlines into the /etc/passwd file. If the system was configured to use NIS, this could lead to existing NIS groups or users gaining or losing access to the system, resulting in a denial of service or unauthorized access.
