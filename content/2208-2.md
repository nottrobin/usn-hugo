* Ubuntu 12.10

### Summary

OpenStack Quantum could be made to expose sensitive information over the network.

### Software description

* quantum 

### Details

USN-2208-1 fixed vulnerabilities in OpenStack Cinder. This update provides the corresponding updates for OpenStack Quantum.

Original advisory details:

 JuanFra Rodriguez Cardoso discovered that OpenStack Cinder did not enforce SSL connections when Nova was configured to use QPid and qpid_protocol is set to &#39;ssl&#39;. If a remote attacker were able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive information. Ubuntu does not use QPid with Nova by default.

Ubuntu 12.10
 : [python-quantum](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/quantum) <span> [2012.2.4-0ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/quantum/2012.2.4-0ubuntu1.1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
