### mozilla-thunderbird vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.04
* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

A buffer overflow was discovered in the XBM image handler. By tricking an user into opening a specially crafted XBM image, an attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges. (CAN-2005-2701)

Mats Palmgren discovered a buffer overflow in the Unicode string parser. Unicode strings that contained &quot;zero-width non-joiner&quot; characters caused a browser crash, which could possibly even exploited to execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges. (CAN-2005-2702)

Georgi Guninski reported an integer overflow in the JavaScript engine. This could be exploited to run arbitrary code under some conditions. (CAN-2005-2705)

Peter Zelezny discovered that URLs which are passed to Thunderbird on the command line are not correctly protected against interpretation by the shell. If Thunderbird is configured as the default handler for &quot;mailto:&quot; URLs, this could be exploited to execute arbitrary code with user privileges by tricking the user into clicking on a specially crafted URL (for example, in an email or chat client). (CAN-2005-2968)

This update also fixes some less critical issues which are described at http://www.mozilla.org/security/announce/mfsa2005-58.html. (CAN-2005-2703, CAN-2005-2704, CAN-2005-2706, CAN-2005-2707)

The &quot;enigmail&quot; plugin has been updated to work with the new Thunderbird and Mozilla versions.
