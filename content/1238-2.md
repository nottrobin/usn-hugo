### puppet regression

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.04

### Summary

USN-1238-1 caused a regression on Ubuntu 11.04. 

### Software description

* puppet 

### Details

USN-1238-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Puppet. The upstream patch introduced a regression in Ubuntu 11.04 when executing certain commands. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that Puppet incorrectly handled the non-default &quot;certdnsnames&quot; option when generating certificates. If this setting was added to puppet.conf, the puppet master’s DNS alt names were added to the X.509 Subject Alternative Name field of all certificates, not just the puppet master’s certificate. An attacker that has an incorrect agent certificate in his possession can use it to impersonate the puppet master in a man-in-the-middle attack. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 11.04
 : [puppet-common](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/puppet) <span> [2.6.4-2ubuntu2.6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/puppet/2.6.4-2ubuntu2.6) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
