    It was discovered that PHP did not sanitize certain error messages when display_errors is enabled, which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks when processing the output. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing server output during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data (such as passwords), within the same domain.

### php5 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* php5 

### Details

It was discovered that PHP did not sanitize certain error messages when display_errors is enabled, which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks when processing the output. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing server output during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data (such as passwords), within the same domain. ([CVE-2008-5814](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5814))

It was discovered that PHP did not properly handle the mbstring.func_overload setting within .htaccess files when using virtual hosts. A virtual host administrator could use this flaw to cause settings to be applied to other virtual hosts on the same server. ([CVE-2009-0754](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0754))

It was discovered that PHP did not properly handle certain malformed strings when being parsed by the json_decode function. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw and cause the PHP server to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 and 8.10. ([CVE-2009-1271](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1271))
