    Martin Carpenter discovered that pt_chown in the GNU C Library did not properly check permissions for tty files. A local attacker could use this to gain administrative privileges or expose sensitive information.

### eglibc, glibc vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 15.10
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the GNU C Library. 

### Software description

* eglibc 

* glibc 

### Details

Martin Carpenter discovered that pt_chown in the GNU C Library did not properly check permissions for tty files. A local attacker could use this to gain administrative privileges or expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-2856](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2207">CVE-2013-2207</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2856))

Robin Hack discovered that the Name Service Switch (NSS) implementation in the GNU C Library did not properly manage its file descriptors. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (infinite loop). ([CVE-2014-8121](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8121))

Joseph Myers discovered that the GNU C Library did not properly handle long arguments to functions returning a representation of Not a Number (NaN). An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (stack exhaustion leading to an application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-9761](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-9761))

Arjun Shankar discovered that in certain situations the nss_dns code in the GNU C Library did not properly account buffer sizes when passed an unaligned buffer. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-1781](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1781))

Sumit Bose and Lukas Slebodnik discovered that the Name Service Switch (NSS) implementation in the GNU C Library did not handle long lines in the files databases correctly. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-5277](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-5277))

Adam Nielsen discovered that the strftime function in the GNU C Library did not properly handle out-of-range argument data. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2015-8776](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8776))

Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll discovered that the GNU C Library allowed the pointer-guarding protection mechanism to be disabled by honoring the LD_POINTER_GUARD environment variable across privilege boundaries. A local attacker could use this to exploit an existing vulnerability more easily. ([CVE-2015-8777](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8777))

Szabolcs Nagy discovered that the hcreate functions in the GNU C Library did not properly check its size argument, leading to an integer overflow. An attacker could use to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-8778](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8778))

Maksymilian Arciemowicz discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in the catopen function in the GNU C Library when handling long catalog names. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2015-8779](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8779))

Florian Weimer discovered that the getnetbyname implementation in the GNU C Library did not properly handle long names passed as arguments. An attacker could use to cause a denial of service (stack exhaustion leading to an application crash). ([CVE-2016-3075](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-3075))
