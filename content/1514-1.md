     A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s macvtap device driver, which is used in KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) to create a network bridge between host and guest. A privleged user in a guest could exploit this flaw to crash the host, if the vhost_net module is loaded with the experimental_zcopytx option enabled.

### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

 A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s macvtap device driver, which is used in KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) to create a network bridge between host and guest. A privleged user in a guest could exploit this flaw to crash the host, if the vhost_net module is loaded with the experimental_zcopytx option enabled. ([CVE-2012-2119](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2119))

An error was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s network TUN/TAP device implementation. A local user with access to the TUN/TAP interface (which is not available to unprivileged users until granted by a root user) could exploit this flaw to crash the system or potential gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2012-2136](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2136))

A flaw was found in how the Linux kernel&#39;s KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) subsystem handled MSI (Message Signaled Interrupts). A local unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service or potentially elevate privileges. ([CVE-2012-2137](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2137))

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel&#39;s Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol implementation. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-2372](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2372))

Ulrich Obergfell discovered an error in the Linux kernel&#39;s memory management subsystem on 32 bit PAE systems with more than 4GB of memory installed. A local unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to crash the system. ([CVE-2012-2373](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2373))

It was discovered that hypervkvpd, which is distributed in the Linux kernel, was not correctly validating the origin on Netlink messages. An untrusted local user can cause a denial of service of Linux guests in Hyper-V virtualization environments. ([CVE-2012-2669](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2669))

Dan Rosenberg discovered flaws in the Linux kernel&#39;s NCI (Near Field Communication Controller Interface). A remote attacker could exploit these flaws to crash the system or potentially execute privileged code. ([CVE-2012-3364](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3364))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s epoll system call. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system. ([CVE-2012-3375](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3375))

Some errors where discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s UDF file system, which is used to mount some CD-ROMs and DVDs. An unprivileged local user could use these flaws to crash the system. ([CVE-2012-3400](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3400))

A flaw was discovered in the madvise feature of the Linux kernel&#39;s memory subsystem. An unprivileged local use could exploit the flaw to cause a denial of service (crash the system). ([CVE-2012-3511](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3511))

Denys Fedoryshchenko discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s TCP receive processing for IPv4. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel resource consumption) via a flood of SYN+FIN TCP packets. ([CVE-2012-6638](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-6638)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-1417-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [3.2.0-1417.23](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1417.23) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
