    Iwan Pieterse discovered that, if you select &quot;Go Back&quot; at the final message displayed by the alternate or server CD installer (&quot;Installation complete&quot;) and then continue with the installation from the installer&#39;s main menu, the root password is left blank rather than locked. This was due to an error while clearing out the root password from the installer&#39;s memory to avoid possible information leaks.

### Installer vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Details

Iwan Pieterse discovered that, if you select &quot;Go Back&quot; at the final message displayed by the alternate or server CD installer (&quot;Installation complete&quot;) and then continue with the installation from the installer&#39;s main menu, the root password is left blank rather than locked. This was due to an error while clearing out the root password from the installer&#39;s memory to avoid possible information leaks.

Installations from the alternate or server CDs when the user selected &quot;Continue&quot; when the &quot;Installation complete&quot; message was first displayed are not affected by this bug. Installations from the desktop CD are not affected by this bug at all.

When you upgrade your passwd package to the newest version, it will detect this condition and lock the root password if it was previously blank. The next point release of Ubuntu 6.06 LTS will include a corrected installer.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : passwd <span>1:4.0.13-7ubuntu3.2</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the necessary changes.
