    Sebastian Krahmer discovered that Swift used the loads function in the pickle Python module when it was configured to use memcached. A remote attacker on the same network as memcached could exploit this to execute arbitrary code. This update adds a new memcache_serialization_support option to support secure json serialization. For details on this new option, please see /usr/share/doc/swift-proxy/memcache.conf-sample. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. ([CVE-2012-4406](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4406))

### Details

Sebastian Krahmer discovered that Swift used the loads function in the pickle Python module when it was configured to use memcached. A remote attacker on the same network as memcached could exploit this to execute arbitrary code. This update adds a new memcache_serialization_support option to support secure json serialization. For details on this new option, please see /usr/share/doc/swift-proxy/memcache.conf-sample. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. ([CVE-2012-4406](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4406))

Alex Gaynor discovered that Swift did not safely generate XML. An attacker could potentially craft an account name to generate arbitrary XML responses to trigger vulnerabilties in software parsing Swift&#39;s XML. ([CVE-2013-2161](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2161)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 13.04
 : [python-swift](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/swift) <span> [1.8.0-0ubuntu1.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/swift/1.8.0-0ubuntu1.2) </span> 

Ubuntu 12.10
 : [python-swift](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/swift) <span> [1.7.4-0ubuntu2.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/swift/1.7.4-0ubuntu2.2) </span> 

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [python-swift](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/swift) <span> [1.4.8-0ubuntu2.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/swift/1.4.8-0ubuntu2.2) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to restart Swift to make all the necessary changes.
