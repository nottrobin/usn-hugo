description: |
    During an audit of the Samba 3.x code base Stefan Esser discovered a Unicode file name buffer overflow within the handling of TRANSACT2_QFILEPATHINFO replies. A malicious samba user with write access to a share could exploit this by creating specially crafted path names (files with very long names containing Unicode characters) that would overflow an internal buffer and could lead to remote execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the samba server.

### samba vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

During an audit of the Samba 3.x code base Stefan Esser discovered a Unicode file name buffer overflow within the handling of TRANSACT2_QFILEPATHINFO replies. A malicious samba user with write access to a share could exploit this by creating specially crafted path names (files with very long names containing Unicode characters) that would overflow an internal buffer and could lead to remote execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the samba server.

Since the samba server usually (by default) runs as root, this flaw can lead to privilege escalation and unbounded system compromise.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 4.10
 : samba 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).
