### Details

Darragh O&#39;Reilly discovered that the Ubuntu packaging for OpenStack Nova did not properly set up its sudo configuration. If a different flaw was found in OpenStack Nova, this vulnerability could be used to escalate privileges. This issue only affected Ubuntu 13.10 and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2013-1068](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1068))

Bernhard M. Wiedemann and Pedraig Brady discovered that OpenStack Nova did not properly verify the virtual size of a QCOW2 images. A remote authenticated attacker could exploit this to create a denial of service via disk consumption. This issue did not affect Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2013-4469](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4463">CVE-2013-4463</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4469))

JuanFra Rodriguez Cardoso discovered that OpenStack Nova did not enforce SSL connections when Nova was configured to use QPid and qpid_protocol is set to &#39;ssl&#39;. If a remote attacker were able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive information. Ubuntu does not use QPid with Nova by default. This issue did not affect Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2013-6491](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-6491))

Loganathan Parthipan discovered that OpenStack Nova did not properly create expected files during KVM live block migration. A remote authenticated attacker could exploit this to obtain root disk snapshot contents via ephemeral storage. This issue did not affect Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2013-7130](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-7130))

Stanislaw Pitucha discovered that OpenStack Nova did not enforce the image format when rescuing an instance. A remote authenticated attacker could exploit this to read host files. In the default installation, attackers would be isolated by the libvirt guest AppArmor profile. This issue only affected Ubuntu 13.10. ([CVE-2014-0134](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-0134))

Mark Heckmann discovered that OpenStack Nova did not enforce RBAC policy when adding security group rules via the EC2 API. A remote authenticated user could exploit this to gain unintended access to this API. This issue only affected Ubuntu 13.10. ([CVE-2014-0167](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-0167))
