### perl regression

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Software description

* perl 

### Details

USN-700-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Perl. Due to problems with the Ubuntu 8.04 build, some Perl .ph files were missing from the resulting update. This update fixes the problem. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Jonathan Smith discovered that the Archive::Tar Perl module did not correctly handle symlinks when extracting archives. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted tar file, a remote attacker could over-write arbitrary files. ([CVE-2008-5303](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-4829">CVE-2007-4829</a>) Tavis Ormandy and Will Drewry discovered that Perl did not correctly handle certain utf8 characters in regular expressions. If a user or automated system were tricked into using a specially crafted expression, a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial of service. Ubuntu 8.10 was not affected by this issue. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-1927">CVE-2008-1927</a>) A race condition was discovered in the File::Path Perl module&#39;s rmtree function. If a local attacker successfully raced another user&#39;s call of rmtree, they could create arbitrary setuid binaries. Ubuntu 6.06 and 8.10 were not affected by this issue. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5302">CVE-2008-5302</a>) A race condition was discovered in the File::Path Perl module&#39;s rmtree function. If a local attacker successfully raced another user&#39;s call of rmtree, they could delete arbitrary files. Ubuntu 6.06 was not affected by this issue. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5303)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
 : [perl](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/perl) <span> [5.8.8-12ubuntu0.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/perl/5.8.8-12ubuntu0.4) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).
