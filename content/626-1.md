### firefox-3.0, xulrunner-1.9 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Software description

* firefox-3.0 

* xulrunner-1.9 

### Details

A flaw was discovered in the browser engine. A variable could be made to overflow causing the browser to crash. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-2785](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2785))

Billy Rios discovered that Firefox and xulrunner, as used by browsers such as Epiphany, did not properly perform URI splitting with pipe symbols when passed a command-line URI. If Firefox or xulrunner were passed a malicious URL, an attacker may be able to execute local content with chrome privileges. ([CVE-2008-2933](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2933)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
 : [firefox-3.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox-3.0) <span> [3.0.1+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox-3.0/3.0.1+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.3) </span> 
 : [xulrunner-1.9](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xulrunner-1.9) <span> [1.9.0.1+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xulrunner-1.9/1.9.0.1+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.8.04.3) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Firefox and any applications that use xulrunner, such as Epiphany, to effect the necessary changes.
