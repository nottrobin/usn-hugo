### firefox vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 7.10
* Ubuntu 7.04
* Ubuntu 6.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* firefox 

### Details

It was discovered that Firefox incorrectly associated redirected sites as the origin of &quot;jar:&quot; contents. A malicious web site could exploit this to modify or steal confidential data (such as passwords) from other web sites. ([CVE-2007-5947](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-5947))

Various flaws were discovered in the layout and JavaScript engines. By tricking a user into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2007-5959](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-5959))

Gregory Fleischer discovered that it was possible to use JavaScript to manipulate Firefox&#39;s Referer header. A malicious web site could exploit this to conduct cross-site request forgeries against sites that relied only on Referer headers for protection from such attacks. ([CVE-2007-5960](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-5960))
