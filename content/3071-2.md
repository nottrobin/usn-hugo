### linux-lts-trusty vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-trusty 

### Details

USN-3071-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-5244](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5244))

Yue Cao et al discovered a flaw in the TCP implementation&#39;s handling of challenge acks in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (reset connection) or inject content into an TCP stream. ([CVE-2016-5696](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5696))

Pengfei Wang discovered a race condition in the MIC VOP driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-5728](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5728))

Cyril Bur discovered that on PowerPC platforms, the Linux kernel mishandled transactional memory state on exec(). A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5828](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5828))

It was discovered that a heap based buffer overflow existed in the USB HID driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5829](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5829)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-95-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty) <span> [3.13.0-95.142~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-95.142~precise1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-95-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty) <span> [3.13.0-95.142~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-95.142~precise1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
