A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
* Ubuntu 5.10

### Details

Sean Larsson of iDefense Labs discovered that the MISC-XC extension of Xorg did not correctly verify the size of allocated memory. An authenticated user could send a specially crafted X11 request and execute arbitrary code with root privileges. ([CVE-2007-1003](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-1003))

Greg MacManus of iDefense Labs discovered that the BDF font handling code in Xorg and FreeType did not correctly verify the size of allocated memory. If a user were tricked into using a specially crafted font, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with root privileges. ([CVE-2007-1352](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-1351">CVE-2007-1351</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-1352))
