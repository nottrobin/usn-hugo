### heimdal vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04
* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

A remote Denial of Service vulnerability was discovered in the heimdal implementation of the telnet daemon. A remote attacker could force the server to crash due to a NULL de-reference before the user logged in, resulting in inetd turning telnetd off because it forked too fast.
