### xmlrpc-c vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in XML-RPC for C and C++. 

### Software description

* xmlrpc-c 

### Details

It was discovered that the Expat code in XML-RPC for C and C++ unexpectedly called srand in certain circumstances. This could reduce the security of calling applications. ([CVE-2012-6702](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-6702))

It was discovered that the Expat code in XML-RPC for C and C++ incorrectly handled seeding the random number generator. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-5300](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5300))

Gustavo Grieco discovered that the Expat code in XML-RPC for C and C++ incorrectly handled malformed XML data. If a user or application linked against XML-RPC for C and C++ were tricked into opening a crafted XML file, an attacker could cause a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-0718](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-0718))

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [libxmlrpc-c++4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xmlrpc-c) <span> [1.16.33-3.1ubuntu5.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xmlrpc-c/1.16.33-3.1ubuntu5.2) </span> 
 : [libxmlrpc-core-c3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xmlrpc-c) <span> [1.16.33-3.1ubuntu5.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xmlrpc-c/1.16.33-3.1ubuntu5.2) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart any applications linked against XML-RPC for C and C++ to effect the necessary changes.
