### mozilla-thunderbird vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Details

Various flaws have been reported that allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with user privileges by tricking the user into opening a malicious email containing JavaScript. Please note that JavaScript is disabled by default for emails, and it is not recommended to enable it. ([CVE-2006-4571](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4253">CVE-2006-4253</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4565">CVE-2006-4565</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4566">CVE-2006-4566</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4571))

The NSS library did not sufficiently check the padding of PKCS #1 v1.5 signatures if the exponent of the public key is 3 (which is widely used for CAs). This could be exploited to forge valid signatures without the need of the secret key. ([CVE-2006-4340](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4340))

Jon Oberheide reported a way how a remote attacker could trick users into downloading arbitrary extensions with circumventing the normal SSL certificate check. The attacker would have to be in a position to spoof the victim&#39;s DNS, causing them to connect to sites of the attacker&#39;s choosing rather than the sites intended by the victim. If they gained that control and the victim accepted the attacker&#39;s cert for the Mozilla update site, then the next update check could be hijacked and redirected to the attacker&#39;s site without detection. ([CVE-2006-4567](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4567))

Georgi Guninski discovered that even with JavaScript disabled, a malicous email could still execute JavaScript when the message is viewed, replied to, or forwarded by putting the script in a remote XBL file loaded by the message. ([CVE-2006-4570](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4570))
