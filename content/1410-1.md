### linux-ec2 vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

The system could be made to crash under certain conditions. 

### Software description

* linux-ec2 

### Details

Louis Rilling discovered a flaw in Linux kernel&#39;s clone command when CLONE_IO is specified. An unprivileged local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-2.6.32-344-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2) <span> [2.6.32-344.46](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2/2.6.32-344.46) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
