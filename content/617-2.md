### samba regression

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 7.10
* Ubuntu 7.04
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* samba 

### Details

USN-617-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Samba. The upstream patch introduced a regression where under certain circumstances accessing large files might cause the client to report an invalid packet length error. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Samba developers discovered that nmbd could be made to overrun a buffer during the processing of GETDC logon server requests. When samba is configured as a Primary or Backup Domain Controller, a remote attacker could send malicious logon requests and possibly cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-1105](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-4572">CVE-2007-4572</a>) Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research discovered that Samba did not properly perform bounds checking when parsing SMB replies. A remote attacker could send crafted SMB packets and execute arbitrary code. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-1105))
