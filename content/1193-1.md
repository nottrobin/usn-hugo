### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.04

### Summary

Multiple kernel flaws have been fixed. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

 Timo Warns discovered that the GUID partition parsing routines did not correctly validate certain structures. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted block device to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1577](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1577))

Phil Oester discovered that the network bonding system did not correctly handle large queues. On some systems, a remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1581](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1581))

Ben Hutchings reported a flaw in the kernel&#39;s handling of corrupt LDM partitions. A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service or escalate privileges. ([CVE-2011-2182](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2182))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that taskstats listeners were not correctly handled. A local attacker could expoit this to exhaust memory and CPU resources, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2484](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2484))

Sami Liedes discovered that ext4 did not correctly handle missing root inodes. A local attacker could trigger the mount of a specially crafted filesystem to cause the system to crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2493](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2493))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s AppArmor security interface when invalid information was written to it. An unprivileged local user could use this to cause a denial of service on the system. ([CVE-2011-3619](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3619))

Scot Doyle discovered that the bridge networking interface incorrectly handled certain network packets. A remote attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-4087](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4087))

A bug was found in the way headroom check was performed in udp6_ufo_fragment() function. A remote attacker could use this flaw to crash the system. ([CVE-2011-4326](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4326))
