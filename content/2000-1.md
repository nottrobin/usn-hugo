    It was discovered that Nova did not properly enforce the is_public property when determining flavor access. An authenticated attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information in private flavors. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.10 and 13.10.

### nova vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 13.04
* Ubuntu 12.10
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Nova could be made to crash if it received specially crafted network requests.

### Software description

* nova 

### Details

It was discovered that Nova did not properly enforce the is_public property when determining flavor access. An authenticated attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information in private flavors. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.10 and 13.10. ([CVE-2013-4278](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2256">CVE-2013-2256</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4278))

Grant Murphy discovered that Nova would allow XML entity processing. A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this using the Nova API to cause a denial of service via resource exhaustion. This issue only affected Ubuntu 13.10. ([CVE-2013-4179](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4179))

Vishvananda Ishaya discovered that Nova inefficiently handled network security group updates when Nova was configured to use nova-network. An authenticated attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-4185](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4185))

Jaroslav Henner discovered that Nova did not properly handle certain inputs to the instance console when Nova was configured to use Apache Qpid. An authenticated attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service on the compute node running the instance. By default, Ubuntu uses RabbitMQ instead of Qpid. ([CVE-2013-4261](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4261))
