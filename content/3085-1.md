description: It was discovered that the GDK-PixBuf library did not properly handle

### Details

It was discovered that the GDK-PixBuf library did not properly handle specially crafted bmp images, leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted bmp file, a remote attacker could use this flaw to cause GDK-PixBuf to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2015-7552](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7552))

It was discovered that the GDK-PixBuf library contained an integer overflow when handling certain images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted image file, a remote attacker could use this flaw to cause GDK-PixBuf to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2015-8875](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8875))

Franco Costantini discovered that the GDK-PixBuf library contained an out-of-bounds write error when parsing an ico file. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted ico file, a remote attacker could use this flaw to cause GDK-PixBuf to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2016-6352](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-6352))
