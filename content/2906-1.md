    Alexander Cherepanov discovered that GNU cpio incorrectly handled symbolic links when used with the --no-absolute-filenames option. If a user or automated system were tricked into extracting a specially-crafted cpio archive, a remote attacker could possibly use this issue to write arbitrary files. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2015-1197](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1197))
