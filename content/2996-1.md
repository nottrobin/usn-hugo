Sergej Schumilo, Hendrik Schwartke, and Ralf Spenneberg discovered that the Linux kernel&#39;s USB driver for Digi AccelePort serial converters did not properly validate USB device descriptors. An attacker with physical access could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-3140](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-3140))

It was discovered that the IPv4 implementation in the Linux kernel did not perform the destruction of inet device objects properly. An attacker in a guest OS could use this to cause a denial of service (networking outage) in the host OS. ([CVE-2016-3156](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-3156))

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel did not properly context- switch IOPL on 64-bit PV Xen guests. An attacker in a guest OS could use this to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash), gain privileges, or obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-3157](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-3157))

Hector Marco and Ismael Ripoll discovered that the Linux kernel would improperly disable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) for x86 processes running in 32 bit mode if stack-consumption resource limits were disabled. A local attacker could use this to make it easier to exploit an existing vulnerability in a setuid/setgid program. ([CVE-2016-3672](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-3672))

It was discovered that an out-of-bounds write could occur when handling incoming packets in the USB/IP implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-3955](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-3955))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the ANSI/IEEE 802.2 LLC type 2 Support implementations in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-4485](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4485))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the routing netlink socket interface (rtnetlink) implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-4486](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4486)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-104-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-104.145](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-104.145) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-104-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-104.145](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-104.145) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-104-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-104.145](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-104.145) </span>

 : [linux-image-3.2.0-104-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-104.145](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-104.145) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-104-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-104.145](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-104.145) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
