* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Libtasn1 could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it processed specially crafted data.

### Software description

* libtasn1-3 

* libtasn1-6 

### Details

It was discovered that Libtasn1 incorrectly handled certain ASN.1 data structures. An attacker could exploit this with specially crafted ASN.1 data and cause applications using Libtasn1 to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2014-3467](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3467))

It was discovered that Libtasn1 incorrectly handled negative bit lengths. An attacker could exploit this with specially crafted ASN.1 data and cause applications using Libtasn1 to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-3468](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3468))

It was discovered that Libtasn1 incorrectly handled certain ASN.1 data. An attacker could exploit this with specially crafted ASN.1 data and cause applications using Libtasn1 to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2014-3469](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3469))
