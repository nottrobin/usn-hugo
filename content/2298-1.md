### oxide-qt vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Oxide. 

### Software description

* oxide-qt 

### Details

A type confusion bug was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2014-1730](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1730))

A type confusion bug was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2014-1731](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1731))

Multiple security issues including memory safety bugs were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2014-3162](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1735">CVE-2014-1735</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3162))

Multiple use-after-free issues were discovered in the WebSockets implementation. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2014-1740](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1740))

Multiple integer overflows were discovered in CharacterData implementation. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2014-1741](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1741))

Multiple use-after-free issues were discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2014-1743](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1742">CVE-2014-1742</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1743))

An integer overflow bug was discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2014-1744](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1744))

An out-of-bounds read was discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafter website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash. ([CVE-2014-1746](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1746))

It was discovered that Blink allowed scrollbar painting to extend in to the parent frame in some circumstances. An attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct clickjacking attacks via UI redress. ([CVE-2014-1748](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1748))

An integer underflow was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafter website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2014-3152](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3152))

A use-after-free was discovered in Chromium. If a use were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2014-3154](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3154))

A security issue was discovered in the SPDY implementation. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2014-3155](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3155))

A heap overflow was discovered in Chromium. If a use were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2014-3157](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3157))

It was discovered that Blink did not enforce security rules for subresource loading in SVG images. If a user opened a site that embedded a specially crafted image, an attacker could exploit this to log page views. ([CVE-2014-3160](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3160))

It was discovered that the SpeechInput feature in Blink could be activated without consent or any visible indication. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could exploit this to eavesdrop on the user. ([CVE-2014-3803](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3803))
