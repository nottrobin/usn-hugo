### likewise-open regression

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Regression when starting services. 

### Software description

* likewise-open 

### Details

USN-964-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Likewise Open. The upstream fixes were incomplete, which caused problems running certain services. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Matt Weatherford discovered that Likewise Open did not correctly check password expiration for the local-provider account. A local attacker could exploit this to log into a system they would otherwise not have access to. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [likewise-open](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/likewise-open) <span> [5.4.0.42111-2ubuntu1.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/likewise-open/5.4.0.42111-2ubuntu1.2) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
