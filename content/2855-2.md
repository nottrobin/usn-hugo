Original advisory details:

 Thilo Uttendorfer discovered that the Samba LDAP server incorrectly handled certain packets. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the LDAP server to stop responding, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 15.04 and Ubuntu 15.10. ([CVE-2015-8467](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-3223">CVE-2015-3223</a>) Jan Kasprzak discovered that Samba incorrectly handled certain symlinks. A remote attacker could use this issue to access files outside the exported share path. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-5252">CVE-2015-5252</a>) Stefan Metzmacher discovered that Samba did not enforce signing when creating encrypted connections. If a remote attacker were able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive information. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-5296">CVE-2015-5296</a>) It was discovered that Samba incorrectly performed access control when using the VFS shadow_copy2 module.

(<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-5299">CVE-2015-5299</a>) Douglas Bagnall discovered that Samba incorrectly handled certain string lengths. A remote attacker could use this issue to possibly access sensitive information. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-5330">CVE-2015-5330</a>) It was discovered that the Samba LDAP server incorrectly handled certain packets. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the LDAP server to stop responding, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 15.04 and Ubuntu 15.10. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7540">CVE-2015-7540</a>) Andrew Bartlett discovered that Samba incorrectly checked administrative privileges during creation of machine accounts. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass intended access restrictions in certain environments. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 15.04 and Ubuntu 15.10.
