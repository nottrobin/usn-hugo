By sending a message containing a very long URL, a remote attacker could crash Gaim or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. This was not possible on all protocols, due to message length restrictions. Jabber are SILC were known to be vulnerable. (CAN-2005-1261)

Siebe Tolsma discovered a Denial of Service attack in the MSN handler. By sending a specially crafted SLP message with an empty body, a remote attacker could crash Gaim. (CAN-2005-1262)
