### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

Ben Hawkes discovered an integer overflow in the Linux netfilter implementation. On systems running 32 bit kernels, a local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-3135](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-3135))

It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did not ensure a data structure was initialized before referencing it after an error condition occurred. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-4470](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4470))

Sasha Levin discovered that a use-after-free existed in the percpu allocator in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-4794](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4794))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the netlink implementation of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-5243](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5243)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-4.4.0-34-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [4.4.0-34.53](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/4.4.0-34.53) </span> 
 : [linux-image-4.4.0-34-powerpc-e500mc](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [4.4.0-34.53](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/4.4.0-34.53) </span> 
 : [linux-image-4.4.0-34-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [4.4.0-34.53](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/4.4.0-34.53) </span> 
 : [linux-image-4.4.0-34-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [4.4.0-34.53](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/4.4.0-34.53) </span> 
 : [linux-image-4.4.0-34-powerpc64-emb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [4.4.0-34.53](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/4.4.0-34.53) </span> 
 : [linux-image-4.4.0-34-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [4.4.0-34.53](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/4.4.0-34.53) </span> 
 : [linux-image-4.4.0-34-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [4.4.0-34.53](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/4.4.0-34.53) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
