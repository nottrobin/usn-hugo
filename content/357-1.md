    Sebastian Krahmer of the SuSE security team discovered that the System.CodeDom.Compiler classes used temporary files in an insecure way. This could allow a symbolic link attack to create or overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the user invoking the program. Under some circumstances, a local attacker could also exploit this to inject arbitrary code into running Mono processes.
