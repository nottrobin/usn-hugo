### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

 Nadav Amit reported that the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) mishandles noncanonical addresses when emulating instructions that change the rip (Instruction Pointer). A guest user with access to I/O or the MMIO can use this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) of the guest. ([CVE-2014-3647](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3647))

A flaw was discovered with the handling of the invept instruction in the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem of the Linux kernel. An unprivileged guest user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) on the guest. ([CVE-2014-3646](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3646))

Lars Bull reported a race condition in the PIT (programmable interrupt timer) emulation in the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local guest user with access to PIT i/o ports could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash) on the host. ([CVE-2014-3611](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3611))

Lars Bull and Nadav Amit reported a flaw in how KVM (the Kernel Virtual Machine) handles noncanonical writes to certain MSR registers. A privileged guest user can exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel panic) on the host. ([CVE-2014-3610](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3610))

A bounds check error was discovered in the driver for the Logitech Unifying receivers and devices. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to to cause a denial of service (invalid kfree) or to execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2014-3182](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3182))

Raphael Geissert reported a NULL pointer dereference in the Linux kernel&#39;s CIFS client. A remote CIFS server could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact by deleting IPC$ share during resolution of DFS referrals. ([CVE-2014-7145](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-7145)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-39-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.13.0-39.66](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.13.0-39.66) </span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
