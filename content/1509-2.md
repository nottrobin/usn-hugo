Original advisory details:

 Benoit Jacob, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bill McCloskey, Brian Smith, Gary Kwong, Christoph Diehl, Chris Jones, Brad Lassey, and Kyle Huey discovered memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2012-1967](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1948">CVE-2012-1948</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1949">CVE-2012-1949</a>) Mario Gomes discovered that the address bar may be incorrectly updated. Drag-and-drop events in the address bar may cause the address of the previous site to be displayed while a new page is loaded. An attacker could exploit this to conduct phishing attacks. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1950">CVE-2012-1950</a>) Abhishek Arya discovered four memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

Calls to history.forward and history.back could be used to navigate to a site while the address bar still displayed the previous site. A remote attacker could exploit this to conduct phishing attacks. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1955">CVE-2012-1955</a>) Mario Heiderich discovered that HTML &lt;embed&gt; tags were not filtered out of the HTML &lt;description&gt; of RSS feeds. A remote attacker could exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via javascript execution in the HTML feed view. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1957">CVE-2012-1957</a>) Arthur Gerkis discovered a use-after-free vulnerability. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1958">CVE-2012-1958</a>) Bobby Holley discovered that same-compartment security wrappers (SCSW) could be bypassed to allow XBL access. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1959">CVE-2012-1959</a>) Tony Payne discovered an out-of-bounds memory read in Mozilla&#39;s color management library (QCMS). If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted color profile, an attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1960">CVE-2012-1960</a>) Frédéric Buclin discovered that the X-Frame-Options header was ignored when its value was specified multiple times. An attacker could exploit this to conduct clickjacking attacks. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1961">CVE-2012-1961</a>) Bill Keese discovered a memory corruption vulnerability. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1962">CVE-2012-1962</a>) Karthikeyan Bhargavan discovered an information leakage vulnerability in the Content Security Policy (CSP) 1.0 implementation. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit this to access a user&#39;s OAuth 2.0 access tokens and OpenID credentials. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1963">CVE-2012-1963</a>) Matt McCutchen discovered a clickjacking vulnerability in the certificate warning page.

(<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1964">CVE-2012-1964</a>) Mario Gomes and Soroush Dalili discovered that javascript was not filtered out of feed URLs. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted URL, an attacker could possibly exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1965">CVE-2012-1965</a>) A vulnerability was discovered in the context menu of data: URLs. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted URL, an attacker could possibly exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1966">CVE-2012-1966</a>) It was discovered that the execution of javascript: URLs was not properly handled in some cases. A remote attacker could exploit this to execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1967))
