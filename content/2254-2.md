    USN-2254-1 fixed vulnerabilities in PHP. The fix for [CVE-2014-0185](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-0185) further restricted the permissions on the PHP FastCGI Process Manager (FPM) UNIX socket. This update grants socket access to the www-data user and group so installations and documentation relying on the previous socket permissions will continue to function.

### Details

USN-2254-1 fixed vulnerabilities in PHP. The fix for [CVE-2014-0185](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-0185) further restricted the permissions on the PHP FastCGI Process Manager (FPM) UNIX socket. This update grants socket access to the www-data user and group so installations and documentation relying on the previous socket permissions will continue to function.

Original advisory details:

 Christian Hoffmann discovered that the PHP FastCGI Process Manager (FPM) set incorrect permissions on the UNIX socket. A local attacker could use this issue to possibly elevate their privileges. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 13.10, and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-4049](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-0185">CVE-2014-0185</a>) Francisco Alonso discovered that the PHP Fileinfo component incorrectly handled certain CDF documents. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause PHP to hang or crash, resulting in a denial of service. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-0237">CVE-2014-0237</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-0238">CVE-2014-0238</a>) Stefan Esser discovered that PHP incorrectly handled DNS TXT records. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause PHP to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code.
