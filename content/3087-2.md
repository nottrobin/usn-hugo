### openssl regression

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

USN-3087-1 introduced a regression in OpenSSL. 

### Software description

* openssl 

### Details

USN-3087-1 fixed vulnerabilities in OpenSSL. The fix for [CVE-2016-2182](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2182) was incomplete and caused a regression when parsing certificates. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled the OCSP Status Request extension. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause memory consumption, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-6306](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-6304">CVE-2016-6304</a>) Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL used undefined behaviour when performing pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue has only been addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS in this update. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2177">CVE-2016-2177</a>) CÃ©sar Pereida, Billy Brumley, and Yuval Yarom discovered that OpenSSL did not properly use constant-time operations when performing DSA signing. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a cache-timing attack and recover private DSA keys. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2178">CVE-2016-2178</a>) Quan Luo discovered that OpenSSL did not properly restrict the lifetime of queue entries in the DTLS implementation. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to consume memory, resulting in a denial of service. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2179">CVE-2016-2179</a>) Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory in the TS_OBJ_print_bio() function. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2180">CVE-2016-2180</a>) It was discovered that the OpenSSL incorrectly handled the DTLS anti-replay feature. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2181">CVE-2016-2181</a>) Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly validated division results. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2182">CVE-2016-2182</a>) Karthik Bhargavan and Gaetan Leurent discovered that the DES and Triple DES ciphers were vulnerable to birthday attacks. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to obtain clear text data from long encrypted sessions. This update moves DES from the HIGH cipher list to MEDIUM. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2183">CVE-2016-2183</a>) Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain ticket lengths. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-6302">CVE-2016-6302</a>) Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory in the MDC2_Update() function. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-6303">CVE-2016-6303</a>) Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly performed certain message length checks. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-6306))
