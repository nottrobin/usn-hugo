    Stefan Esser discovered that mod_status did not force a character set, which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to XSS attacks when processing the output.  If a user were tricked into viewing server status output during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data (such as passwords), within the same domain.  By default, mod_status is disabled in Ubuntu. ([CVE-2006-5752](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-5752))

*16 August 2007*

### apache2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 7.04
* Ubuntu 6.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Details

Stefan Esser discovered that mod_status did not force a character set, which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to XSS attacks when processing the output. If a user were tricked into viewing server status output during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data (such as passwords), within the same domain. By default, mod_status is disabled in Ubuntu. ([CVE-2006-5752](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-5752))

Niklas Edmundsson discovered that the mod_cache module could be made to crash using a specially crafted request. A remote user could use this to cause a denial of service if Apache was configured to use a threaded worker. By default, mod_cache is disabled in Ubuntu. ([CVE-2007-1863](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-1863))

A flaw was discovered in the signal handling of Apache. A local attacker could trick Apache into sending SIGUSR1 to other processes. The vulnerable code was only present in Ubuntu Feisty. ([CVE-2007-3304](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-3304))
