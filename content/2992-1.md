### Details

An unspecified security issue was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions. ([CVE-2016-1673](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1673))

An issue was discovered with Document reattachment in Blink in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions. ([CVE-2016-1675](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1675))

A type confusion bug was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-1677](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1677))

A heap overflow was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-1678](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1678))

A use-after-free was discovered in the V8ValueConverter implementation in Chromium in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-1679](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1679))

A use-after-free was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-1680](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1680))

A security issue was discovered in ServiceWorker registration in Blink in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) protections. ([CVE-2016-1682](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1682))

An out-of-bounds memory access was discovered in libxslt. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-1683](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1683))

An integer overflow was discovered in libxslt. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service (application crash or resource consumption). ([CVE-2016-1684](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1684))

An out-of-bounds read was discovered in the regular expression implementation in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service (application crash). ([CVE-2016-1688](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1688))

A heap overflow was discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-1689](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1689))

A heap overflow was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-1691](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1691))

It was discovered that Blink permits cross-origin loading of stylesheets by a service worker even when the stylesheet download has an incorrect MIME type. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions. ([CVE-2016-1692](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1692))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-1703](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1695">CVE-2016-1695</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1703))

It was discovered that Blink does not prevent frame navigation during DocumentLoader detach operations. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions. ([CVE-2016-1697](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1697))

A parameter sanitization bug was discovered in the devtools subsystem in Blink. An attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass intended access restrictions. ([CVE-2016-1699](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1699))

An out-of-bounds read was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service (application crash). ([CVE-2016-1702](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1702))
