### openssl vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.10
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 11.10
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in OpenSSL. 

### Software description

* openssl 

### Details

Adam Langley and Wolfgang Ettlingers discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain crafted CBC data when used with AES-NI. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 12.10. ([CVE-2012-2686](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2686))

Stephen Henson discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly performed signature verification for OCSP responses. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-0166](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0166))

Nadhem Alfardan and Kenny Paterson discovered that the TLS protocol as used in OpenSSL was vulnerable to a timing side-channel attack known as the &quot;Lucky Thirteen&quot; issue. A remote attacker could use this issue to perform plaintext-recovery attacks via analysis of timing data. ([CVE-2013-0169](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0169))
