### linux-lts-trusty vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

The system could be made to crash or run programs as an administrator. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-trusty 

### Details

Yevgeny Pats discovered that the session keyring implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly reference count when joining an existing session keyring. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-76-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty) <span> [3.13.0-76.120~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-76.120~precise1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-76-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty) <span> [3.13.0-76.120~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-76.120~precise1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
