### Details

Stefan Esser discovered that the GD library incorrectly handled memory when processing certain images. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted image, an attacker could cause a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.10. ([CVE-2016-10166](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-10166))

It was discovered that the GD library incorrectly handled certain malformed images. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted image, an attacker could cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-10167](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-10167))

It was discovered that the GD library incorrectly handled certain malformed images. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted image, an attacker could cause a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-10168](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-10168))

Ibrahim El-Sayed discovered that the GD library incorrectly handled certain malformed TGA images. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted TGA image, an attacker could cause a denial of service.
