    A null pointer dereference flaw was discovered in the the Linux kernel&#39;s SCTP implementation when ASCONF is used. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) via a malformed INIT chunk. ([CVE-2014-7841](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-7841))

### linux-lts-trusty vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-trusty 

### Details

A null pointer dereference flaw was discovered in the the Linux kernel&#39;s SCTP implementation when ASCONF is used. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) via a malformed INIT chunk. ([CVE-2014-7841](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-7841))

A race condition with MMIO and PIO transactions in the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem of the Linux kernel was discovered. A guest OS user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) via a specially crafted application. ([CVE-2014-7842](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-7842))

Miloš Prchlík reported a flaw in how the ARM64 platform handles a single byte overflow in __clear_user. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) by reading one byte beyond a /dev/zero page boundary. ([CVE-2014-7843](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-7843))

A stack buffer overflow was discovered in the ioctl command handling for the Technotrend/Hauppauge USB DEC devices driver. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2014-8884](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8884)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-44-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty) <span> [3.13.0-44.73~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-44.73~precise1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-44-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty) <span> [3.13.0-44.73~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-44.73~precise1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
