### gaim vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

The Gaim developers discovered that the HTML parser did not sufficiently validate its input. This allowed a remote attacker to crash the Gaim client by sending certain malformed HTML messages. (CAN-2005-0208, CAN-2005-0473)

Another lack of sufficient input validation was found in the &quot;Oscar&quot; protocol handler which is used for ICQ and AIM. By sending specially crafted packets, remote users could trigger an infinite loop in Gaim which caused Gaim to become unresponsive and hang. (CAN-2005-0472)

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 4.10
 : gaim
