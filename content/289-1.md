### tiff vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04

### Details

A buffer overflow has been found in the tiff2pdf utility. By tricking an user into processing a specially crafted TIF file with tiff2pdf, this could potentially be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user. ([CVE-2006-2193](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-2193))

A. Alejandro Hernï¿½ez discovered a buffer overflow in the tiffsplit utility. By calling tiffsplit with specially crafted long arguments, an user can execute arbitrary code. If tiffsplit is used in e. g. a web-based frontend or similar automated system, this could lead to remote arbitary code execution with the privileges of that system. (In normal interactive command line usage this is not a vulnerability.) ([CVE-2006-2656](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-2656))

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : libtiff-tools <span>3.7.4-1ubuntu3.1</span>

Ubuntu 5.10
 : libtiff-tools <span>3.7.3-1ubuntu1.4</span>

Ubuntu 5.04
 : libtiff-tools <span>3.6.1-5ubuntu0.5</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the necessary changes.
