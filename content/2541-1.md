### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

 The Linux kernel&#39;s splice system call did not correctly validate its parameters. A local, unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2014-7822](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-7822))

A flaw was discovered in how Thread Local Storage (TLS) is handled by the task switching function in the Linux kernel for x86_64 based machines. A local user could exploit this flaw to bypass the Address Space Layout Radomization (ASLR) protection mechanism. ([CVE-2014-9419](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-9419))

Dmitry Chernenkov discovered a buffer overflow in eCryptfs&#39; encrypted file name decoding. A local unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2014-9683](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-9683))

Carl H Lunde discovered that the UDF file system (CONFIG_UDF_FS) failed to verify symlink size info. A local attacker, who is able to mount a malicous UDF file system image, could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly cause other undesired behaviors. ([CVE-2014-9728](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-9728))

Carl H Lunde discovered that the UDF file system (CONFIG_UDF_FS) did not valid inode size information . A local attacker, who is able to mount a malicous UDF file system image, could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly cause other undesired behaviors. ([CVE-2014-9729](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-9729))

Carl H Lunde discovered that the UDF file system (CONFIG_UDF_FS) did not correctly verify the component length for symlinks. A local attacker, who is able to mount a malicous UDF file system image, could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly cause other undesired behaviors. ([CVE-2014-9730](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-9730))

Carl H Lunde discovered an information leak in the UDF file system (CONFIG_UDF_FS). A local attacker, who is able to mount a malicous UDF file system image, could exploit this flaw to read potential sensitve kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-9731](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-9731))

Sun Baoliang discovered a use after free flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) subsystem during INIT collisions. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. ([CVE-2015-1421](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1421)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-79-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-79.115](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-79.115) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-79-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-79.115](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-79.115) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-79-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-79.115](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-79.115) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-79-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-79.115](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-79.115) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-79-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-79.115](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-79.115) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-79-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-79.115](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-79.115) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-79-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-79.115](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-79.115) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
