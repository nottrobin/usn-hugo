### reportbug information disclosure

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Rolf Leggewie discovered two information disclosure bugs in reportbug.

The per-user configuration file ~/.reportbugrc was created world-readable. If it contained email smarthost passwords, these were readable by any other user on the computer storing the home directory.

reportbug usually includes the settings from ~/.reportbugrc in generated bug reports. This included the &quot;smtppasswd&quot; setting (the password for an SMTP email smarthost) as well. The password is now hidden from reports.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 4.10
 : reportbug 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

None
