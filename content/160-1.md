### apache2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.04
* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Marc Stern discovered a buffer overflow in the SSL module&#39;s certificate revocation list (CRL) handler. If Apache is configured to use a malicious CRL, this could possibly lead to a server crash or arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the Apache web server. (CAN-2005-1268)

Watchfire discovered that Apache insufficiently verified the &quot;Transfer-Encoding&quot; and &quot;Content-Length&quot; headers when acting as an HTTP proxy. By sending a specially crafted HTTP request, a remote attacker who is authorized to use the proxy could exploit this to bypass web application firewalls, poison the HTTP proxy cache, and conduct cross-site scripting attacks against other proxy users. (CAN-2005-2088)

Ubuntu 5.04

 : apache2-mpm-prefork 

Ubuntu 4.10
