### linux, linux-raspi2 vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 16.10

### Summary

The system could be made to crash or run programs as an administrator. 

### Software description

* linux 

* linux-raspi2 

### Details

It was discovered that the xfrm framework for transforming packets in the Linux kernel did not properly validate data received from user space. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 16.10
 : [linux-image-4.8.0-45-powerpc-e500mc](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [4.8.0-45.48](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/4.8.0-45.48) </span> 
 : linux-image-powerpc-smp <span>4.8.0.45.57</span>

 : linux-image-lowlatency <span>4.8.0.45.57</span>
 : linux-image-raspi2 <span>4.8.0.1032.36</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
