### thunderbird update

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 9.04

### Software description

* thunderbird 

### Details

USN-927-1 fixed vulnerabilities in NSS. This update provides the Thunderbird update to use the new NSS.

Original advisory details:

 Marsh Ray and Steve Dispensa discovered a flaw in the TLS and SSLv3 protocols. If an attacker could perform a man in the middle attack at the start of a TLS connection, the attacker could inject arbitrary content at the beginning of the user&#39;s session. This update adds support for the new new renegotiation extension and will use it when the server supports it. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 9.04
 : [thunderbird](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/thunderbird) <span> [2.0.0.24+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.9.04.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/thunderbird/2.0.0.24+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.9.04.2) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Thunderbird to effect the necessary changes.
