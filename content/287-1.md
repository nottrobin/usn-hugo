### nagios vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04

### Details

The nagios CGI scripts did not sufficiently check the validity of the HTTP Content-Length attribute. By sending a specially crafted HTTP request with an invalidly large Content-Length value to the Nagios server, a remote attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with web server privileges.

Please note that the Apache 2 web server already checks for valid Content-Length values, so installations using Apache 2 (the only web server officially supported in Ubuntu) are not vulnerable to this flaw.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 5.10
 : nagios-common 

Ubuntu 5.04
 : nagios-common 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

None
