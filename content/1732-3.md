### Details

USN-1732-1 fixed vulnerabilities in OpenSSL. The fix for [CVE-2012-2686](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0169">CVE-2013-0169</a> and <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2686) was reverted in USN-1732-2 because of a regression. This update restores the security fix, and includes an extra fix from upstream to address the AES-NI regression. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Adam Langley and Wolfgang Ettlingers discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain crafted CBC data when used with AES-NI. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 12.10. ([CVE-2013-0169](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2686">CVE-2012-2686</a>) Nadhem Alfardan and Kenny Paterson discovered that the TLS protocol as used in OpenSSL was vulnerable to a timing side-channel attack known as the &quot;Lucky Thirteen&quot; issue. A remote attacker could use this issue to perform plaintext-recovery attacks via analysis of timing data. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0169))
