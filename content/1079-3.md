### Details

USN-1079-2 fixed vulnerabilities in OpenJDK 6 for armel (ARM) architectures in Ubuntu 9.10 and Ubuntu 10.04 LTS. This update fixes vulnerabilities in OpenJDK 6 for armel (ARM) architectures for Ubuntu 10.10.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that untrusted Java applets could create domain name resolution cache entries, allowing an attacker to manipulate name resolution within the JVM. ([CVE-2011-0706](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4448">CVE-2010-4448</a>) It was discovered that the Java launcher did not did not properly setup the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. A local attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4450">CVE-2010-4450</a>) It was discovered that within the Swing library, forged timer events could allow bypass of SecurityManager checks. This could allow an attacker to access restricted resources. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4465">CVE-2010-4465</a>) It was discovered that certain bytecode combinations confused memory management within the HotSpot JVM. This could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service through an application crash or possibly inject code. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4469">CVE-2010-4469</a>) It was discovered that the way JAXP components were handled allowed them to be manipulated by untrusted applets. An attacker could use this to bypass XML processing restrictions and elevate privileges. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4470">CVE-2010-4470</a>) It was discovered that the Java2D subcomponent, when processing broken CFF fonts could leak system properties. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4471">CVE-2010-4471</a>) It was discovered that a flaw in the XML Digital Signature component could allow an attacker to cause untrusted code to replace the XML Digital Signature Transform or C14N algorithm implementations. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4472">CVE-2010-4472</a>) Konstantin Preisser and others discovered that specific double literals were improperly handled, allowing a remote attacker to cause a denial of service. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4476">CVE-2010-4476</a>) It was discovered that the JNLPClassLoader class when handling multiple signatures allowed remote attackers to gain privileges due to the assignment of an inappropriate security descriptor. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0706)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.10
 : [openjdk-6-jre-headless](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjdk-6b18) <span> [6b18-1.8.7-0ubuntu2.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjdk-6b18/6b18-1.8.7-0ubuntu2.1) </span> 
 : [icedtea6-plugin](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjdk-6b18) <span> [6b18-1.8.7-0ubuntu2.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjdk-6b18/6b18-1.8.7-0ubuntu2.1) </span> 
 : [openjdk-6-jre](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjdk-6b18) <span> [6b18-1.8.7-0ubuntu2.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openjdk-6b18/6b18-1.8.7-0ubuntu2.1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to restart any Java services, applications or applets to make all the necessary changes.
