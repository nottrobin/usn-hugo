description: |
    Philip Pettersson discovered that the Linux kernel&#39;s ASN.1 DER decoder did not properly process certificate files with tags of indefinite length. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges.

### linux-raspi2 vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 15.10

### Summary

The system could be made to crash or run programs as an administrator. 

### Software description

* linux-raspi2 

### Details

Philip Pettersson discovered that the Linux kernel&#39;s ASN.1 DER decoder did not properly process certificate files with tags of indefinite length. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 15.10
 : [linux-image-4.2.0-1029-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-raspi2) <span> [4.2.0-1029.38](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-raspi2/4.2.0-1029.38) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
