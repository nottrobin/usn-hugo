### php4, php5 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04

### Details

The phpinfo() PHP function did not properly sanitize long strings. A remote attacker could use this to perform cross-site scripting attacks against sites that have publicly-available PHP scripts that call phpinfo(). Please note that it is not recommended to publicly expose phpinfo(). ([CVE-2006-0996](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-0996))

An information disclosure has been reported in the html_entity_decode() function. A script which uses this function to process arbitrary user-supplied input could be exploited to expose a random part of memory, which could potentially reveal sensitive data. ([CVE-2006-1490](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-1490))

The wordwrap() function did not sufficiently check the validity of the &#39;break&#39; argument. An attacker who could control the string passed to the &#39;break&#39; parameter could cause a heap overflow; however, this should not happen in practical applications. ([CVE-2006-1990](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-1990))

The substr_compare() function did not sufficiently check the validity of the &#39;offset&#39; argument. A script which passes untrusted user-defined values to this parameter could be exploited to crash the PHP interpreter. ([CVE-2006-1991](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-1991))

In certain situations, using unset() to delete a hash entry could cause the deletion of the wrong element, which would leave the specified variable defined. This could potentially cause information disclosure in security-relevant operations. ([CVE-2006-3017](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3017))

In certain situations the session module attempted to close a data file twice, which led to memory corruption. This could potentially be exploited to crash the PHP interpreter, though that could not be verified. ([CVE-2006-3018](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3018))

This update also fixes various bugs which allowed local scripts to bypass open_basedir and &#39;safe mode&#39; restrictions by passing special arguments to tempnam() ([CVE-2006-3011](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-1494">CVE-2006-1494</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-2660">CVE-2006-2660</a>), copy() (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-1608">CVE-2006-1608</a>), the curl module (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-2563">CVE-2006-2563</a>), or error_log() (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3011)).

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : php5-cli <span>5.1.2-1ubuntu3.1</span>
 : php5-cgi <span>5.1.2-1ubuntu3.1</span>
 : libapache2-mod-php5 <span>5.1.2-1ubuntu3.1</span>
 : php5-curl <span>5.1.2-1ubuntu3.1</span>

Ubuntu 5.10
 : php5-cli <span>5.0.5-2ubuntu1.3</span>
 : php5-cgi <span>5.0.5-2ubuntu1.3</span>
 : libapache2-mod-php5 <span>5.0.5-2ubuntu1.3</span>
 : php5-curl <span>5.0.5-2ubuntu1.3</span>

Ubuntu 5.04
 : libapache2-mod-php4 <span>4:4.3.10-10ubuntu4.5</span>
 : php4-cgi <span>4:4.3.10-10ubuntu4.5</span>
 : php4-cli <span>4:4.3.10-10ubuntu4.5</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the necessary changes.
