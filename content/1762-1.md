### apt vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.10
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 11.10

### Summary

An attacker could trick APT into installing altered packages. 

### Software description

* apt 

### Details

Ansgar Burchardt discovered that APT incorrectly handled InRelease files. If a remote attacker were able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could potentially be used to install altered packages.

This update corrects the issue by disabling InRelease file support completely. Please note that this update breaks third-party repositories that provide only a InRelease file and no separate Release and Release.gpg files. The default Ubuntu repositories do not use InRelease files. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.10
 : [apt](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt) <span> [0.9.7.5ubuntu5.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt/0.9.7.5ubuntu5.4) </span> 

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [apt](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt) <span> [0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.10](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt/0.8.16~exp12ubuntu10.10) </span> 

Ubuntu 11.10
 : [apt](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt) <span> [0.8.16~exp5ubuntu13.7](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apt/0.8.16~exp5ubuntu13.7) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).
