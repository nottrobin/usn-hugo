### enscript vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Erik Sj�d discovered several vulnerabilities in enscript which could cause arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the user calling enscript.

Quotes and other shell escape characters in titles and file names were not handled in previous versions. (CAN-2004-1184)

Previous versions supported reading EPS data not only from a file, but also from an arbitrary command pipe. Since checking for unwanted side effects is infeasible, this feature has been disabled after consultation with the authors of enscript. (CAN-2004-1185)

Finally, this update fixes two buffer overflows which were triggered by certain input files. (CAN-2004-1186)

These issues can lead to privilege escalation if enscript is called automatically from web server applications like viewcvs.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 4.10
 : enscript 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

None
