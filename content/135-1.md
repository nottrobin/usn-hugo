    Tavis Ormandy found an integer overflow in the GNU debugger. By tricking an user into merely load a specially crafted executable, an attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running gdb. However, loading untrusted binaries without actually executing them is rather uncommon, so the risk of this flaw is low. (CAN-2005-1704)

### gdb vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.04
* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Tavis Ormandy found an integer overflow in the GNU debugger. By tricking an user into merely load a specially crafted executable, an attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running gdb. However, loading untrusted binaries without actually executing them is rather uncommon, so the risk of this flaw is low. (CAN-2005-1704)

Tavis Ormandy also discovered that gdb loads and executes the file &quot;.gdbinit&quot; in the current directory even if the file belongs to a different user. By tricking an user into run gdb in a directory with a malicious .gdbinit file, a local attacker could exploit this to run arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user invoking gdb. (CAN-2005-1705)

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 5.04
 : gdb 

Ubuntu 4.10
 : gdb 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).
