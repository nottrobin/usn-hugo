### lxc regression

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Summary

USN-2753-1 introduced a regression in LXC. 

### Software description

* lxc 

### Details

USN-2753-1 fixed a vulnerability in LXC. The update caused a regression that prevented some containers from starting. This regression only affected containers that had an absolute path specified as a bind mount target in their configuration file. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Roman Fiedler discovered a directory traversal flaw in lxc-start. A local attacker with access to an LXC container could exploit this flaw to run programs inside the container that are not confined by AppArmor or expose unintended files in the host to the container. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 : [lxc](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lxc) <span> [1.0.7-0ubuntu0.6](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/lxc/1.0.7-0ubuntu0.6) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
