### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

A denial of service flaw was discovered in the Btrfs file system in the Linux kernel. A local user could cause a denial of service by creating a large number of files with names that have the same CRC32 hash value. ([CVE-2012-5374](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5374))

A denial of service flaw was discovered in the Btrfs file system in the Linux kernel. A local user could cause a denial of service (prevent file creation) for a victim, by creating a file with a specific CRC32C hash value in a directory important to the victim. ([CVE-2012-5375](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5375))

Dan Carpenter discovered an information leak in the HP Smart Array and Compaq SMART2 disk-array driver in the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2147](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2147)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-56-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-56.86](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-56.86) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-56-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-56.86](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-56.86) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-56-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-56.86](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-56.86) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-56-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-56.86](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-56.86) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-56-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-56.86](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-56.86) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-56-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-56.86](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-56.86) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-56-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-56.86](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-56.86) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
