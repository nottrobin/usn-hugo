### linux-ec2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Multiple kernel vulnerabilities. 

### Software description

* linux-ec2 

### Details

 Dan Rosenberg discovered that multiple terminal ioctls did not correctly initialize structure memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read portions of kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2010-4075](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4075))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the socket filters did not correctly initialize structure memory. A local attacker could create malicious filters to read portions of kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2010-4158](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4158))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the SCSI subsystem did not correctly validate iov segments. A local attacker with access to a SCSI device could send specially crafted requests to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2010-4668](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4163">CVE-2010-4163</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4668)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-2.6.32-314-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2) <span> [2.6.32-314.27](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2/2.6.32-314.27) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
