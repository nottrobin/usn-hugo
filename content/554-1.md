    Bastien Roucaries discovered that dvips as included in tetex-bin and texlive-bin did not properly perform bounds checking. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted dvi file, dvips could be made to crash and execute code as the user invoking the program.

### Details

Bastien Roucaries discovered that dvips as included in tetex-bin and texlive-bin did not properly perform bounds checking. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted dvi file, dvips could be made to crash and execute code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2007-5935](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-5935))

Joachim Schrod discovered that the dviljk utilities created temporary files in an insecure way. Local users could exploit a race condition to create or overwrite files with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2007-5936](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-5936))

Joachim Schrod discovered that the dviljk utilities did not perform bounds checking in many instances. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted dvi file, the dviljk utilities could be made to crash and execute code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2007-5937](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-5937))
