Multiple memory safety issues were discovered in Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-1669](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0801">CVE-2013-0801</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1669))

Cody Crews discovered that some constructors could be used to bypass restrictions enforced by their Chrome Object Wrapper (COW). An attacker could exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2013-1670](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1670))

It was discovered that the file input element could expose the full local path under certain conditions. An attacker could potentially exploit this to steal sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-1671](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1671))

A use-after-free was discovered when resizing video content whilst it is playing. An attacker could potentially exploit this to execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-1674](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1674))

It was discovered that some DOMSVGZoomEvent functions could be used without being properly initialized, which could lead to information leakage. ([CVE-2013-1675](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1675))

Abhishek Arya discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-1681](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1676">CVE-2013-1676</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1677">CVE-2013-1677</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1678">CVE-2013-1678</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1679">CVE-2013-1679</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1680">CVE-2013-1680</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1681))
