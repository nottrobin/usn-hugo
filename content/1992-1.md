### linux vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

The system could be made to expose sensitive information to a local user. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel when reading broadcast messages from the notify_policy interface of the IPSec key_socket. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially sensitive information in kernel memory. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-55-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-55.85](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-55.85) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-55-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-55.85](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-55.85) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-55-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-55.85](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-55.85) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-55-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-55.85](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-55.85) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-55-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-55.85](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-55.85) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-55-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-55.85](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-55.85) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-55-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-55.85](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-55.85) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
