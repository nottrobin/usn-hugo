An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg systemcalls when used with x25 protocol sockets in the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7271](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-7271))

mpb reported an information leak in the Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks support (IEEE 802.15.4) in the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel stack memory. ([CVE-2013-7281](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-7281))

A flaw was discovered in the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol implementation in the Linux kernel for systems that lack RDS transports. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-7339](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-7339))

halfdog reported an error in the AMD K7 and K8 platform support in the Linux kernel.

([CVE-2014-1446](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1446))

Matthew Thode reported a denial of service vulnerability in the Linux kernel when SELinux support is enabled. A local user with the CAP_MAC_ADMIN capability (and the SELinux mac_admin permission if running in enforcing mode) could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel crash). ([CVE-2014-1874](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1874)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-47-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-quantal) <span> [3.5.0-47.71~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-quantal/3.5.0-47.71~precise1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
