### nss vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 17.04
* Ubuntu 16.10
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in NSS. 

### Software description

* nss 

### Details

Karthik Bhargavan and Gaetan Leurent discovered that the DES and Triple DES ciphers were vulnerable to birthday attacks. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to obtain clear text data from long encrypted sessions. This update causes NSS to limit use of the same symmetric key. ([CVE-2016-2183](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2183))

It was discovered that NSS incorrectly handled Base64 decoding. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause NSS to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-5461](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-5461))

This update refreshes the NSS package to version 3.28.4 which includes the latest CA certificate bundle. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 17.04
 : [libnss3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nss) <span> [2:3.28.4-0ubuntu0.17.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nss/2:3.28.4-0ubuntu0.17.04.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 16.10
 : [libnss3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nss) <span> [2:3.28.4-0ubuntu0.16.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nss/2:3.28.4-0ubuntu0.16.10.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
 : [libnss3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nss) <span> [2:3.28.4-0ubuntu0.16.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nss/2:3.28.4-0ubuntu0.16.04.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 : [libnss3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nss) <span> [2:3.28.4-0ubuntu0.14.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nss/2:3.28.4-0ubuntu0.14.04.1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

This update uses a new upstream release, which includes additional bug fixes. After a standard system update you need to restart any applications that use NSS, such as Evolution and Chromium, to make all the necessary changes.
