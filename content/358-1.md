    XFOCUS Security Team discovered that the AVI decoder used in xine-lib did not correctly validate certain headers.  By tricking a user into playing an AVI with malicious headers, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the target user&#39;s privileges.

### ffmpeg, xine-lib vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04

### Details

XFOCUS Security Team discovered that the AVI decoder used in xine-lib did not correctly validate certain headers. By tricking a user into playing an AVI with malicious headers, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the target user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2006-4799](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4799))

Multiple integer overflows were discovered in ffmpeg and tools that contain a copy of ffmpeg (like xine-lib and kino), for several types of video formats. By tricking a user into running a video player that uses ffmpeg on a stream with malicious content, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the target user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2006-4800](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4800))
