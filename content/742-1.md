    It was discovered that JasPer did not correctly handle memory allocation when parsing certain malformed JPEG2000 images. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted image with an application that uses libjasper, an attacker could cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges.

([CVE-2008-3520](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3520))

It was discovered that JasPer created temporary files in an insecure way. Local users could exploit a race condition and cause a denial of service in libjasper applications. ([CVE-2008-3521](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3521))

It was discovered that JasPer did not correctly handle certain formatting operations. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted image with an application that uses libjasper, an attacker could cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2008-3522](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3522))
