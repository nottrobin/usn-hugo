### php4, php5 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04
* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Eric Romang discovered a local Denial of Service vulnerability in the handling of the &#39;session.save_path&#39; parameter in PHP&#39;s Apache 2.0 module. By setting this parameter to an invalid value in an .htaccess file, a local user could crash the Apache server. ([CVE-2005-3319](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2005-3319))

A Denial of Service flaw was found in the EXIF module. By sending an image with specially crafted EXIF data to a PHP program that automatically evaluates them (e. g. a web gallery), a remote attacker could cause an infinite recursion in the PHP interpreter, which caused the web server to crash. ([CVE-2005-3353](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2005-3353))

Stefan Esser reported a Cross Site Scripting vulnerability in the phpinfo() function. By tricking a user into retrieving a specially crafted URL to a PHP page that exposes phpinfo(), a remote attacker could inject arbitrary HTML or web script into the output page and possibly steal private data like cookies or session identifiers. ([CVE-2005-3388](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2005-3388))

Stefan Esser discovered a vulnerability of the parse_str() function when it is called with just one argument. By calling such programs with specially crafted parameters, a remote attacker could enable the &#39;register_globals&#39; option which is normally turned off for security reasons. Once this option is enabled, the remote attacker could exploit other security flaws of PHP programs which are normally protected by &#39;register_globals&#39; being deactivated. ([CVE-2005-3389](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2005-3389))

Stefan Esser discovered that a remote attacker could overwrite the $GLOBALS array in PHP programs that allow file uploads and run with &#39;register_globals&#39; enabled. Depending on the particular application, this can lead to unexpected vulnerabilities. ([CVE-2005-3390](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2005-3390))

The &#39;gd&#39; image processing and cURL modules did not properly check processed file names against the &#39;open_basedir&#39; and &#39;safe_mode&#39; restrictions, which could be exploited to circumvent these limitations. ([CVE-2005-3391](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2005-3391))

Another bypass of the &#39;open_basedir&#39; and &#39;safe_mode&#39; restrictions was found in virtual() function. A local attacker could exploit this to circumvent these restrictions with specially crafted PHP INI files when virtual Apache 2.0 hosts are used. ([CVE-2005-3392](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2005-3392))

The mb_send_mail() function did not properly check its arguments for invalid embedded line breaks. By setting the &#39;To:&#39; field of an email to a specially crafted value in a PHP web mail application, a remote attacker could inject arbitrary headers into the sent email. ([CVE-2005-3883](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2005-3883))
