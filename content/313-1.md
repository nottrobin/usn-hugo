    It was possible to embed Basic macros in documents in a way that OpenOffice.org would not ask for confirmation about executing them. By tricking a user into opening a malicious document, this could be exploited to run arbitrary Basic code (including local file access and modification) with the user&#39;s privileges.

### openoffice.org-amd64, openoffice.org vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
* Ubuntu 5.04

### Details

It was possible to embed Basic macros in documents in a way that OpenOffice.org would not ask for confirmation about executing them. By tricking a user into opening a malicious document, this could be exploited to run arbitrary Basic code (including local file access and modification) with the user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2006-2198](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-2198))

A flaw was discovered in the Java sandbox which allowed Java applets to break out of the sandbox and execute code without restrictions. By tricking a user into opening a malicious document, this could be exploited to run arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges. This update disables Java applets for OpenOffice.org, since it is not generally possible to guarantee the sandbox restrictions. ([CVE-2006-2199](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-2199))

A buffer overflow has been found in the XML parser. By tricking a user into opening a specially crafted XML file with OpenOffice.org, this could be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2006-3117](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-3117))

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:
