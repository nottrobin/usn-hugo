    Benoit Jacob, Olli Pettay, Jan Varga, Jan de Mooij, Jesse Ruderman, Dan Gohman and Christoph Diehl discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.

### thunderbird vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 13.10
* Ubuntu 12.10
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird. 

### Software description

* thunderbird 

### Details

Benoit Jacob, Olli Pettay, Jan Varga, Jan de Mooij, Jesse Ruderman, Dan Gohman and Christoph Diehl discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1493](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1493))

Atte Kettunen discovered an out-of-bounds read during WAV file decoding. If a user had enabled audio, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash. ([CVE-2014-1497](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1497))

Robert O&#39;Callahan discovered a mechanism for timing attacks involving SVG filters and displacements input to feDisplacementMap. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to steal confidential information across domains. ([CVE-2014-1505](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1505))

Tyson Smith and Jesse Schwartzentruber discovered an out-of-bounds read during polygon rendering in MathML. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to steal confidential information across domains. ([CVE-2014-1508](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1508))

John Thomson discovered a memory corruption bug in the Cairo graphics library. If a user had a malicious extension installed, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1509](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1509))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that web content could open a chrome privileged page and bypass the popup blocker in some circumstances. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1511](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1510">CVE-2014-1510</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1511))

It was discovered that memory pressure during garbage collection resulted in memory corruption in some circumstances. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1512](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1512))

JÃ¼ri Aedla discovered out-of-bounds reads and writes with TypedArrayObject in some circumstances. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1513](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1513))

George Hotz discovered an out-of-bounds write with TypedArrayObject. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-1514](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1514))
