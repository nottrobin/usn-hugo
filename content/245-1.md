    Maksim Orlovich discovered that kjs, the Javascript interpreter engine used by Konqueror and other parts of KDE, did not sufficiently verify the validity of UTF-8 encoded URIs. Specially crafted URIs could trigger a buffer overflow. By tricking an user into visiting a web site with malicious JavaScript code, a remote attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with user privileges.
