### linux-source-2.6.17 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.10

### Details

The compat_sys_mount function allowed local users to cause a denial of service when mounting a smbfs filesystem in compatibility mode. ([CVE-2006-7203](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-7203))

The Omnikey CardMan 4040 driver (cm4040_cs) did not limit the size of buffers passed to read() and write(). A local attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges. ([CVE-2007-0005](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0005))

Due to a variable handling flaw in the ipv6_getsockopt_sticky() function a local attacker could exploit the getsockopt() calls to read arbitrary kernel memory. This could disclose sensitive data. ([CVE-2007-1000](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-1000))

Ilja van Sprundel discovered that Bluetooth setsockopt calls could leak kernel memory contents via an uninitialized stack buffer. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to view sensitive kernel information. ([CVE-2007-1353](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-1353))

A flaw was discovered in the handling of netlink messages. Local attackers could cause infinite recursion leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-1861](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-1861))

A flaw was discovered in the IPv6 stack&#39;s handling of type 0 route headers. By sending a specially crafted IPv6 packet, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service between two IPv6 hosts. ([CVE-2007-2242](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2242))

The random number generator was hashing a subset of the available entropy, leading to slightly less random numbers. Additionally, systems without an entropy source would be seeded with the same inputs at boot time, leading to a repeatable series of random numbers. ([CVE-2007-2453](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2453))

A flaw was discovered in the PPP over Ethernet implementation. Local attackers could manipulate ioctls and cause kernel memory consumption leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-2525](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2525))

An integer underflow was discovered in the cpuset filesystem. If mounted, local attackers could obtain kernel memory using large file offsets while reading the tasks file. This could disclose sensitive data. ([CVE-2007-2875](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2875))

Vilmos Nebehaj discovered that the SCTP netfilter code did not correctly validate certain states. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted packet causing a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-2876](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2876))

Luca Tettamanti discovered a flaw in the VFAT compat ioctls on 64-bit systems. A local attacker could corrupt a kernel_dirent struct and cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-2878](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2878))

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 6.10
 : linux-image-2.6.17-12-mckinley <span>2.6.17.1-12.39</span>
 : linux-image-2.6.17-12-powerpc64-smp <span>2.6.17.1-12.39</span>
 : linux-image-2.6.17-12-server-bigiron <span>2.6.17.1-12.39</span>
 : linux-image-2.6.17-12-hppa64 <span>2.6.17.1-12.39</span>
 : linux-image-2.6.17-12-sparc64-smp <span>2.6.17.1-12.39</span>
 : linux-image-2.6.17-12-generic <span>2.6.17.1-12.39</span>
 : linux-image-2.6.17-12-powerpc-smp <span>2.6.17.1-12.39</span>
 : linux-image-2.6.17-12-itanium <span>2.6.17.1-12.39</span>
 : linux-image-2.6.17-12-hppa32 <span>2.6.17.1-12.39</span>
 : linux-image-2.6.17-12-386 <span>2.6.17.1-12.39</span>
 : linux-image-2.6.17-12-powerpc <span>2.6.17.1-12.39</span>
 : linux-image-2.6.17-12-sparc64 <span>2.6.17.1-12.39</span>
 : linux-image-2.6.17-12-server <span>2.6.17.1-12.39</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to reboot your computer to effect the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the Ubuntu 6.10 kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (linux-386, linux-powerpc, linux-amd64-generic, etc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
