### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.10

### Summary

The system could be made to deny services if it received specially crafted local area network traffic.

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

 Somnath Kotur discovered an error in the Linux kernel&#39;s VLAN (virtual lan) and be2net drivers. An attacker on the local network could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-3347](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3347))

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel&#39;s ext4 file system when mounting a corrupt filesystem. A user-assisted remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-2100](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2100)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 11.10
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-1208-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [3.0.0-1208.18](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/3.0.0-1208.18) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
