    Emese Revfy discovered that in the Linux kernel signal handlers could leak address information across an exec, making it possible to by pass ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization). A local user could use this flaw to by pass ASLR to reliably deliver an exploit payload that would otherwise be stopped (by ASLR).

### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

Emese Revfy discovered that in the Linux kernel signal handlers could leak address information across an exec, making it possible to by pass ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization). A local user could use this flaw to by pass ASLR to reliably deliver an exploit payload that would otherwise be stopped (by ASLR). ([CVE-2013-0914](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0914))

A memory use after free error was discover in the Linux kernel&#39;s tmpfs filesystem. A local user could exploit this flaw to gain privileges or cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-1767](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1767))

Mateusz Guzik discovered a race in the Linux kernel&#39;s keyring. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-1792](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1792))

Mathias Krause discovered a memory leak in the Linux kernel&#39;s crypto report API. A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN could exploit this leak to examine some of the kernel&#39;s stack memory. ([CVE-2013-2546](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2546))

Mathias Krause discovered a memory leak in the Linux kernel&#39;s crypto report API. A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN could exploit this leak to examine some of the kernel&#39;s heap memory. ([CVE-2013-2547](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2547))

Mathias Krause discovered information leaks in the Linux kernel&#39;s crypto algorithm report API. A local user could exploit these flaws to leak kernel stack and heap memory contents. ([CVE-2013-2548](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2548)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-40-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-40.64](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-40.64) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-40-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-40.64](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-40.64) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-40-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-40.64](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-40.64) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-40-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-40.64](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-40.64) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-40-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-40.64](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-40.64) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-40-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-40.64](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-40.64) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-40-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-40.64](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-40.64) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
