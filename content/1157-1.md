### Details

Bob Clary, Kevin Brosnan, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Biesinger, Bas Schouten, Igor Bukanov, Bill McCloskey, Olli Pettay, Daniel Veditz and Marcia Knous discovered multiple memory vulnerabilities in the browser rendering engine. An attacker could possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2011-2375](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2374">CVE-2011-2374</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2375))

Martin Barbella discovered that under certain conditions, viewing a XUL document while JavaScript was disabled caused deleted memory to be accessed. An attacker could potentially use this to crash Firefox or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2011-2373](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2373))

Jordi Chancel discovered a vulnerability on multipart/x-mixed-replace images due to memory corruption. An attacker could potentially use this to crash Firefox or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2011-2377](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2377))

Chris Rohlf and Yan Ivnitskiy discovered an integer overflow vulnerability in JavaScript Arrays. An attacker could potentially use this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2011-2371](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2371))

It was discovered that Firefox&#39;s WebGL textures did not honor same-origin policy. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, an attacker could potentially view image data from a different site. ([CVE-2011-2366](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2366))

Christoph Diehl discovered an out-of-bounds read vulnerability in WebGL code. An attacker could potentially read data that other processes had stored in the GPU. ([CVE-2011-2367](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2367))

Christoph Diehl discovered an invalid write vulnerability in WebGL code. An attacker could potentially use this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2011-2368](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2368))

It was discovered that an unauthorized site could trigger an installation dialog for addons and themes. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, an attacker could possibly trick the user into installing a malicious addon or theme. ([CVE-2011-2370](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2370))

Mario Heiderich discovered a vulnerability in displaying decoded HTML-encoded entities inside SVG elements. An attacker could utilize this to perform cross-site scripting attacks. ([CVE-2011-2369](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2369)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 11.04
 : [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox) <span> [5.0+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.11.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox/5.0+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.11.04.1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to restart Firefox to make all the necessary changes.
