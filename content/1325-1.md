### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.10

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

Peter Huewe discovered an information leak in the handling of reading security-related TPM data. A local, unprivileged user could read the results of a previous TPM command. ([CVE-2011-1162](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1162))

Clement Lecigne discovered a bug in the HFS filesystem. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a kernel oops. ([CVE-2011-2203](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2203))

Han-Wen Nienhuys reported a flaw in the FUSE kernel module. A local user who can mount a FUSE file system could cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-3353](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3353))

A flaw was found in the b43 driver in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service if the system has an active wireless interface using the b43 driver. ([CVE-2011-3359](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3359))

A flaw was found in how the Linux kernel handles user-defined key types. An unprivileged local user could exploit this to crash the system. ([CVE-2011-4110](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4110)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.10
 : [linux-image-2.6.35-903-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [2.6.35-903.29](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/2.6.35-903.29) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.
