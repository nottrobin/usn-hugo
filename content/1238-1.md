title: "USN-1238-1: Puppet vulnerability"
releases: [ ubuntu-10.04-lts ]
date: 2011-10-24 12:00:00
description: |
    It was discovered that Puppet incorrectly handled the non-default &quot;certdnsnames&quot; option when generating certificates. If this setting was added to puppet.conf, the puppet master’s DNS alt names were added to the X.509 Subject Alternative Name field of all certificates, not just the puppet master’s certificate. An attacker that has an incorrect agent certificate in his possession can use it to impersonate the puppet master in a man-in-the-middle attack.
