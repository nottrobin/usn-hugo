* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in libssh. 

### Software description

### Details

Mariusz Ziulek discovered that libssh incorrectly handled certain packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause libssh to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-3146](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-3146))

Aris Adamantiadis discovered that libssh incorrectly generated ephemeral secret keys of 128 bits instead of the recommended 1024 or 2048 bits when using the diffie-hellman-group1 and diffie-hellman-group14 methods. If a remote attacker were able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-0739](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-0739))
