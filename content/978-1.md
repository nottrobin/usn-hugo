### thunderbird vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Thunderbird could be made to crash or possibly run programs as your login if it opened a specially crafted file or website.

### Software description

* thunderbird 

### Details

Several dangling pointer vulnerabilities were discovered in Thunderbird. An attacker could exploit this to crash Thunderbird or possibly run arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-3167](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2760">CVE-2010-2760</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2767">CVE-2010-2767</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-3167))

It was discovered that the XPCSafeJSObjectWrapper (SJOW) security wrapper did not always honor the same-origin policy. If JavaScript was enabled, an attacker could exploit this to run untrusted JavaScript from other domains. ([CVE-2010-2763](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2763))

Matt Haggard discovered that Thunderbird did not honor same-origin policy when processing the statusText property of an XMLHttpRequest object. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could use this to gather information about servers on internal private networks. ([CVE-2010-2764](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2764))

Chris Rohlf discovered an integer overflow when Thunderbird processed the HTML frameset element. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could use this to crash Thunderbird or possibly run arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-2765](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2765))

Several issues were discovered in the browser engine. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could use this to crash Thunderbird or possibly run arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-3168](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2766">CVE-2010-2766</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-3168))

David Huang and Collin Jackson discovered that the &lt;object&gt; tag could override the charset of a framed HTML document in another origin. An attacker could utilize this to perform cross-site scripting attacks. ([CVE-2010-2768](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2768))

Paul Stone discovered that with designMode enabled an HTML selection containing JavaScript could be copied and pasted into a document and have the JavaScript execute within the context of the site where the code was dropped. If JavaScript was enabled, an attacker could utilize this to perform cross-site scripting attacks. ([CVE-2010-2769](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2769))

A buffer overflow was discovered in Thunderbird when processing text runs. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could use this to crash Thunderbird or possibly run arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-3166](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-3166))

Peter Van der Beken, Jason Oster, Jesse Ruderman, Igor Bukanov, Jeff Walden, Gary Kwong and Olli Pettay discovered several flaws in the browser engine. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could use this to crash Thunderbird or possibly run arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-3169](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-3169)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [thunderbird](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/thunderbird) <span> [3.0.7+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/thunderbird/3.0.7+build1+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.10.04.1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to restart Thunderbird to make all the necessary changes.
