Aki Helin discovered an out-of-bounds read when playing malformed MP3 content in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information, cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2015-4475](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-4475))

A use-after-free was discovered during MediaStream playback in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the user invoking Firefox.
