### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s iSCSI subsystem. A remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-2850](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2850))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel when inotify is used to monitor the /dev/ptmx device. A local user could exploit this flaw to discover keystroke timing and potentially discover sensitive information like password length. ([CVE-2013-0160](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0160))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s perf events subsystem for Intel Sandy Bridge and Ivy Bridge processors. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-2146](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2146))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s crypto API. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially sensitive information from the kernel&#39;s stack memory. ([CVE-2013-3076](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-3076))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s rcvmsg path for ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode). A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially sensitive information from the kernel&#39;s stack memory. ([CVE-2013-3222](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-3222))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s recvmsg path for ax25 address family. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially sensitive information from the kernel&#39;s stack memory. ([CVE-2013-3223](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-3223))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s recvmsg path for the bluetooth address family. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially sensitive information from the kernel&#39;s stack memory. ([CVE-2013-3224](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-3224))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s bluetooth rfcomm protocol support. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially sensitive information from the kernel&#39;s stack memory. ([CVE-2013-3225](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-3225))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s CAIF protocol implementation. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially sensitive information from the kernel&#39;s stack memory. ([CVE-2013-3227](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-3227))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s IRDA (infrared) support subsystem. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially sensitive information from the kernel&#39;s stack memory. ([CVE-2013-3228](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-3228))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s s390 - z/VM support. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially sensitive information from the kernel&#39;s stack memory. ([CVE-2013-3229](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-3229))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s llc (Logical Link Layer 2) support. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially sensitive information from the kernel&#39;s stack memory. ([CVE-2013-3231](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-3231))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s receive message handling for the netrom address family. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from the kernel&#39;s stack memory. ([CVE-2013-3232](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-3232))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s Rose X.25 protocol layer. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially sensitive information from the kernel&#39;s stack memory. ([CVE-2013-3234](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-3234))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s TIPC (Transparent Inter Process Communication) protocol implementation. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially sensitive information from the kernel&#39;s stack memory. ([CVE-2013-3235](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-3235)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-1433-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [3.2.0-1433.44](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1433.44) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
