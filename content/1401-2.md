### Details

USN-1401-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Xulrunner. This update provides the corresponding fixes for Thunderbird.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that a flaw in the Mozilla SVG implementation could result in an out-of-bounds memory access if SVG elements were removed during a DOMAttrModified event handler. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash. ([CVE-2012-0464](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3658">CVE-2011-3658</a>) Atte Kettunen discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Gecko Rendering Engine&#39;s handling of SVG animations. An attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the Xulrunner based application. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0457">CVE-2012-0457</a>) Atte Kettunen discovered an out of bounds read vulnerability in the Gecko Rendering Engine&#39;s handling of SVG Filters. An attacker could potentially exploit this to make data from the user&#39;s memory accessible to the page content. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0456">CVE-2012-0456</a>) Soroush Dalili discovered that the Gecko Rendering Engine did not adequately protect against dropping JavaScript links onto a frame. A remote attacker could, through cross-site scripting (XSS), exploit this to modify the contents of the frame or steal confidential data. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0455">CVE-2012-0455</a>) Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the Home button accepted JavaScript links to set the browser Home page. An attacker could use this vulnerability to get the script URL loaded in the privileged about:sessionrestore context. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0458">CVE-2012-0458</a>) Bob Clary, Vincenzo Iozzo, and Willem Pinckaers discovered memory safety issues affecting Firefox. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0461">CVE-2012-0461</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0464))
