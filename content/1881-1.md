### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.10
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-34-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-34.55](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-34.55) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-34-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-34.55](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-34.55) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-34-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-34.55](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-34.55) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-34-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-34.55](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-34.55) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-34-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-34.55](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-34.55) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
