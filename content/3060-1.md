### libgd2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Summary

The GD library could be made to crash or run programs if it processed a specially crafted image file.

### Software description

* libgd2 

### Details

It was discovered that the GD library incorrectly handled certain malformed TGA images. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted TGA image, an attacker could cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-6214](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-6132">CVE-2016-6132</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-6214))

It was discovered that the GD library incorrectly handled memory when using gdImageScale(). A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-6207](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-6207))
