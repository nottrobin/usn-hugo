    Steven Vittitoe reported multiple stack buffer overflows in Linux kernel&#39;s magicmouse HID driver.

### linux-lts-trusty vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-trusty 

### Details

Steven Vittitoe reported multiple stack buffer overflows in Linux kernel&#39;s magicmouse HID driver. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via specially crafted devices. ([CVE-2014-3181](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3181))

Ben Hawkes reported some off by one errors for report descriptors in the Linux kernel&#39;s HID stack. A physically proximate attacker could exploit these flaws to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds write) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2014-3184](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3184))

Several bounds check flaws allowing for buffer overflows were discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s Whiteheat USB serial driver. A physically proximate attacker could exploit these flaws to cause a denial of service (system crash) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2014-3185](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3185))

Steven Vittitoe reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel&#39;s PicoLCD HID device driver. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a specially craft device. ([CVE-2014-3186](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3186))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s associative-array garbage collection implementation. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact by using keyctl operations. ([CVE-2014-3631](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3631))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s UDF filesystem (used on some CD-ROMs and DVDs) when processing indirect ICBs. An attacker who can cause CD, DVD or image file with a specially crafted inode to be mounted can cause a denial of service (infinite loop or stack consumption). ([CVE-2014-6410](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-6410))

James Eckersall discovered a buffer overflow in the Ceph filesystem in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory consumption and panic) or possibly have other unspecified impact via a long unencrypted auth ticket. ([CVE-2014-6416](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-6416))

James Eckersall discovered a flaw in the handling of memory allocation failures in the Ceph filesystem. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecified other impact. ([CVE-2014-6417](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-6417))

James Eckersall discovered a flaw in how the Ceph filesystem validates auth replies. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact. ([CVE-2014-6418](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-6418)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-37-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty) <span> [3.13.0-37.64~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-37.64~precise1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-37-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty) <span> [3.13.0-37.64~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-37.64~precise1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
