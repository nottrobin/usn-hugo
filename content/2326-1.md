* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Oxide. 

### Software description

* oxide-qt 

### Details

A use-after-free was discovered in the SVG implementation in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2014-3168](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3168))

A use-after-free was discovered in the DOM implementation in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2014-3169](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3169))

A use-after-free was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2014-3171](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3171))

It was discovered that WebGL clear calls did not interact properly with the state of a draw buffer. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2014-3173](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3173))

A threading issue was discovered in the Web Audio API during attempts to update biquad filter coefficients. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2014-3174](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3174))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2014-3175](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3175))
