    Jeff Gilbert and Henrik Skupin discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If the user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

### Software description

* thunderbird 

### Details

Jeff Gilbert and Henrik Skupin discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If the user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-1701](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1701))

It was discovered that a document&#39;s URI could be set to the URI of a different document. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2013-1709](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1709))

A flaw was discovered when generating a CRMF request in certain circumstances. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-1710](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1710))

Cody Crews discovered that some Javascript components performed security checks against the wrong URI, potentially bypassing same-origin policy restrictions. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or install addons from a malicious site. ([CVE-2013-1713](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1713))

Federico Lanusse discovered that web workers could bypass cross-origin checks when using XMLHttpRequest. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2013-1714](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1714))

Georgi Guninski and John Schoenick discovered that Java applets could access local files under certain circumstances. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to steal confidential data. ([CVE-2013-1717](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1717))
