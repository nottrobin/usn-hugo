     Pablo Neira Ayuso discovered a flaw in the credentials of netlink messages. An unprivileged local attacker could exploit this by getting a netlink based service, that relies on netlink credentials, to perform privileged actions.

### linux vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

The system could be made to perform privileged actions as an administrator. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

 Pablo Neira Ayuso discovered a flaw in the credentials of netlink messages. An unprivileged local attacker could exploit this by getting a netlink based service, that relies on netlink credentials, to perform privileged actions. ([CVE-2012-3520](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3520))

Mathias Krause discovered information leak in the Linux kernel&#39;s compat ioctl interface. A local user could exploit the flaw to examine parts of kernel stack memory ([CVE-2012-6539](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-6539))

Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel&#39;s getsockopt for IP_VS_SO_GET_TIMEOUT. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine parts of kernel stack memory. ([CVE-2012-6540](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-6540))

Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel&#39;s getsockopt implementation for the Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP). A local user could exploit this flaw to examine some of the kernel&#39;s stack memory. ([CVE-2012-6541](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-6541))

Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel&#39;s getsockname implementation for Logical Link Layer (llc) sockets. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine some of the kernel&#39;s stack memory. ([CVE-2012-6542](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-6542))

Mathias Krause discovered information leaks in the Linux kernel&#39;s Bluetooth Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) implementation. A local user could exploit these flaws to examine some of the kernel&#39;s stack memory. ([CVE-2012-6544](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-6544))

Mathias Krause discovered information leaks in the Linux kernel&#39;s Bluetooth RFCOMM protocol implementation. A local user could exploit these flaws to examine parts of kernel memory. ([CVE-2012-6545](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-6545))

Mathias Krause discovered information leaks in the Linux kernel&#39;s Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networking stack. A local user could exploit these flaws to examine some parts of kernel memory. ([CVE-2012-6546](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-6546))

A flaw was discovered in how netlink sockets validate message origins. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to send netlink message notifications, with spoofed credentials, to subscribed tasks. ([CVE-2012-6689](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-6689))

Mathias Krause discover an error in Linux kernel&#39;s Datagram Congestion Control Protocol (DCCP) Congestion Control Identifier (CCID) use. A local attack could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash) and potentially escalate privileges if the user can mmap page 0. ([CVE-2013-1827](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1827)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-32-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-32.51](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-32.51) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-32-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-32.51](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-32.51) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-32-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-32.51](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-32.51) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-32-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-32.51](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-32.51) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-32-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-32.51](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-32.51) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-32-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-32.51](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-32.51) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-32-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-32.51](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-32.51) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
