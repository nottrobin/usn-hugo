### openssl vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in OpenSSL. 

### Software description

* openssl 

### Details

Adam Langley and Wan-Teh Chang discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain DTLS packets. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2014-3505](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3505))

Adam Langley discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when processing DTLS handshake messages. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to consume memory, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2014-3506](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3506))

Adam Langley discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when processing DTLS fragments. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to leak memory, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-3507](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3507))

Ivan Fratric discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly leaked information in the pretty printing functions. When OpenSSL is used with certain applications, an attacker may use this issue to possibly gain access to sensitive information. ([CVE-2014-3508](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3508))

Gabor Tyukasz discovered that OpenSSL contained a race condition when processing serverhello messages. A malicious server could use this issue to cause clients to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-3509](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3509))

Felix Gröbert discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain DTLS handshake messages. A malicious server could use this issue to cause clients to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2014-3510](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3510))

David Benjamin and Adam Langley discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled fragmented ClientHello messages. If a remote attacker were able to perform a man-in-the-middle attack, this flaw could be used to force a protocol downgrade to TLS 1.0. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-3511](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3511))

Sean Devlin and Watson Ladd discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain SRP parameters. A remote attacker could use this with applications that use SRP to cause a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-3512](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3512))

Joonas Kuorilehto and Riku Hietamäki discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain Server Hello messages that specify an SRP ciphersuite. A malicious server could use this issue to cause clients to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-5139](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-5139)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 : [libssl1.0.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl) <span> [1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.5) </span> 

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [libssl1.0.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl) <span> [1.0.1-4ubuntu5.17](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/1.0.1-4ubuntu5.17) </span> 

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [libssl0.9.8](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl) <span> [0.9.8k-7ubuntu8.20](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/0.9.8k-7ubuntu8.20) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.
