### linux-ec2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ec2 

### Details

Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel&#39;s getsockname implementation for Logical Link Layer (llc) sockets. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine some of the kernel&#39;s stack memory. ([CVE-2012-6542](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-6542))

Mathias Krause discovered information leaks in the Linux kernel&#39;s Bluetooth Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) implementation. A local user could exploit these flaws to examine some of the kernel&#39;s stack memory. ([CVE-2012-6544](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-6544))

Mathias Krause discovered information leaks in the Linux kernel&#39;s Bluetooth RFCOMM protocol implementation. A local user could exploit these flaws to examine parts of kernel memory. ([CVE-2012-6545](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-6545))

Mathias Krause discovered information leaks in the Linux kernel&#39;s Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) networking stack. A local user could exploit these flaws to examine some parts of kernel memory. ([CVE-2012-6546](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-6546))

Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel&#39;s UDF file system implementation. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine some of the kernel&#39;s heap memory. ([CVE-2012-6548](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-6548))

Andrew Jones discovered a flaw with the xen_iret function in Linux kernel&#39;s Xen virtualizeation. In the 32-bit Xen paravirt platform an unprivileged guest OS user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash the system) or gain guest OS privilege. ([CVE-2013-0228](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0228))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s Bluetooth stack when HIDP (Human Interface Device Protocol) support is enabled. A local unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause an information leak from the kernel. ([CVE-2013-0349](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0349))

A flaw was discovered in the Edgeort USB serial converter driver when the device is disconnected while it is in use. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-1774](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1774))

Andrew Honig discovered a flaw in guest OS time updates in the Linux kernel&#39;s KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine). A privileged guest user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash host system) or potential escalate privilege to the host kernel level. ([CVE-2013-1796](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1796)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-2.6.32-351-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2) <span> [2.6.32-351.64](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2/2.6.32-351.64) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.
