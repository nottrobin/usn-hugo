### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.10

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

 An error was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s network TUN/TAP device implementation. A local user with access to the TUN/TAP interface (which is not available to unprivileged users until granted by a root user) could exploit this flaw to crash the system or potential gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2012-2136](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2136))

Ulrich Obergfell discovered an error in the Linux kernel&#39;s memory management subsystem on 32 bit PAE systems with more than 4GB of memory installed. A local unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to crash the system. ([CVE-2012-2373](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2373))

An error was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s memory subsystem (hugetlb). An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash the system). ([CVE-2012-2390](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2390))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s epoll system call. An unprivileged local user could use this flaw to crash the system. ([CVE-2012-3375](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3375))

Some errors where discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s UDF file system, which is used to mount some CD-ROMs and DVDs. An unprivileged local user could use these flaws to crash the system. ([CVE-2012-3400](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3400))

A flaw was discovered in the madvise feature of the Linux kernel&#39;s memory subsystem. An unprivileged local use could exploit the flaw to cause a denial of service (crash the system). ([CVE-2012-3511](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3511)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 11.10
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-24-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.0.0-24.40](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.0.0-24.40) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-24-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.0.0-24.40](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.0.0-24.40) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-24-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.0.0-24.40](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.0.0-24.40) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-24-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.0.0-24.40](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.0.0-24.40) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-24-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.0.0-24.40](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.0.0-24.40) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-24-powerpc](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.0.0-24.40](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.0.0-24.40) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-24-server](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.0.0-24.40](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.0.0-24.40) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-24-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.0.0-24.40](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.0.0-24.40) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
