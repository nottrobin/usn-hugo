### firefox vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
* Ubuntu 5.10

### Details

Several flaws have been found that could be used to perform Cross-site scripting attacks. A malicious web site could exploit these to modify the contents or steal confidential data (such as passwords) from other opened web pages. ([CVE-2007-0996](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-6077">CVE-2006-6077</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0780">CVE-2007-0780</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0800">CVE-2007-0800</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0981">CVE-2007-0981</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0995">CVE-2007-0995</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0996))

The SSLv2 protocol support in the NSS library did not sufficiently check the validity of public keys presented with a SSL certificate. A malicious SSL web site using SSLv2 could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2007-0008](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0008))

The SSLv2 protocol support in the NSS library did not sufficiently verify the validity of client master keys presented in an SSL client certificate. A remote attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code in a server application that uses the NSS library. ([CVE-2007-0009](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0009))

Various flaws have been reported that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with user privileges by tricking the user into opening a malicious web page. ([CVE-2007-1092](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0775">CVE-2007-0775</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0776">CVE-2007-0776</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0777">CVE-2007-0777</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-1092))

Two web pages could collide in the disk cache with the result that depending on order loaded the end of the longer document could be appended to the shorter when the shorter one was reloaded from the cache. It is possible a determined hacker could construct a targeted attack to steal some sensitive data from a particular web page. The potential victim would have to be already logged into the targeted service (or be fooled into doing so) and then visit the malicious site. ([CVE-2007-0778](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0778))

David Eckel reported that browser UI elements--such as the host name and security indicators--could be spoofed by using custom cursor images and a specially crafted style sheet. ([CVE-2007-0779](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0779))

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 6.10
 : libnspr4 <span>2.0.0.2+0dfsg-0ubuntu0.6.10</span>
 : firefox <span>2.0.0.2+0dfsg-0ubuntu0.6.10</span>
 : libnss3 <span>2.0.0.2+0dfsg-0ubuntu0.6.10</span>

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : libnspr4 <span>1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.10-0ubuntu0.6.06.1</span>
 : firefox <span>1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.10-0ubuntu0.6.06.1</span>
 : libnss3 <span>1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.10-0ubuntu0.6.06.1</span>

Ubuntu 5.10
 : firefox <span>1.5.dfsg+1.5.0.10-0ubuntu0.5.10.1</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart Firefox to effect the necessary changes.
