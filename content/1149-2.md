### Details

USN-1149-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. Unfortunately, a regression was introduced that prevented cookies from being stored properly when the hostname was a single character. This update fixes the problem. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Multiple memory vulnerabilities were discovered in the browser rendering engine. An attacker could use these to possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2011-2362](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2364">CVE-2011-2364</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2365">CVE-2011-2365</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2374">CVE-2011-2374</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2376">CVE-2011-2376</a>) Martin Barbella discovered that under certain conditions, viewing a XUL document while JavaScript was disabled caused deleted memory to be accessed. An attacker could potentially use this to crash Firefox or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2373">CVE-2011-2373</a>) Jordi Chancel discovered a vulnerability on multipart/x-mixed-replace images due to memory corruption. An attacker could potentially use this to crash Firefox or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2377">CVE-2011-2377</a>) Chris Rohlf and Yan Ivnitskiy discovered an integer overflow vulnerability in JavaScript Arrays. An attacker could potentially use this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2371">CVE-2011-2371</a>) Multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities were discovered. An attacker could potentially use these to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0083">CVE-2011-0083</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0085">CVE-2011-0085</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2363">CVE-2011-2363</a>) David Chan discovered that cookies did not honor same-origin conventions. This could potentially lead to cookie data being leaked to a third party. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2362))
