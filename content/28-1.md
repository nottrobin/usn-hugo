    Liam Helmer discovered an input validation flaw in sudo. When the standard shell &quot;bash&quot; starts up, it searches the environment for variables with a value beginning with &quot;()&quot;. For each of these variables a function with the same name is created, with the function body filled in from the environment variable&#39;s value.

### sudo vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Liam Helmer discovered an input validation flaw in sudo. When the standard shell &quot;bash&quot; starts up, it searches the environment for variables with a value beginning with &quot;()&quot;. For each of these variables a function with the same name is created, with the function body filled in from the environment variable&#39;s value.

A malicious user with sudo access to a shell script that uses bash can use this feature to substitute arbitrary commands for any non-fully-qualified programs called from the script. Therefore this flaw can lead to privilege escalation.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 4.10
 : sudo 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).
