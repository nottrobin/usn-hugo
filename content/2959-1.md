### openssl vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 15.10
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in OpenSSL. 

### Software description

* openssl 

### Details

Huzaifa Sidhpurwala, Hanno Böck, and David Benjamin discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when decoding ASN.1 structures. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2108](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2108))

Juraj Somorovsky discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly performed padding when the connection uses the AES CBC cipher and the server supports AES-NI. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a padding oracle attack and decrypt traffic. ([CVE-2016-2107](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2107))

Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled large amounts of input data to the EVP_EncodeUpdate() function. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2105](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2105))

Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled large amounts of input data to the EVP_EncryptUpdate() function. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-2106](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2106))

Brian Carpenter discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when ASN.1 data is read from a BIO. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause memory consumption, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2109](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2109))

As a security improvement, this update also modifies OpenSSL behaviour to reject DH key sizes below 1024 bits, preventing a possible downgrade attack. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
 : [libssl1.0.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl) <span> [1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 15.10
 : [libssl1.0.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl) <span> [1.0.2d-0ubuntu1.5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/1.0.2d-0ubuntu1.5) </span> 

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 : [libssl1.0.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl) <span> [1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.19](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.19) </span> 

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [libssl1.0.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl) <span> [1.0.1-4ubuntu5.36](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/1.0.1-4ubuntu5.36) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.
