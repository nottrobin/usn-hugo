### postgresql vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

John Heasman discovered a local privilege escalation in the PostgreSQL server. Any user could use the LOAD extension to load any shared library into the PostgreSQL server; the library&#39;s initialisation function was then executed with the permissions of the server.

Now the use of LOAD is restricted to the database superuser (usually &#39;postgres&#39;).

Note: Since there is no way for normal database users to create arbitrary files, this vulnerability is not exploitable remotely, e. g. by uploading a shared library in the form of a Binary Large Object (BLOB) to a public web server.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 4.10
 : postgresql 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

None
