By sending specially crafted SLP packets, a remote attacker could exploit this to crash the SLP server or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the &quot;daemon&quot; user. Likewise, a malicious SLP server could exploit the client library vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the SLP client application.
