### oxide-qt vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Oxide. 

### Software description

* oxide-qt 

### Details

An issue was discovered in Blink involving the provisional URL for an initially empty document. An attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the currently displayed URL. ([CVE-2016-5141](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5141))

A use-after-free was discovered in the WebCrypto implementation in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5142](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5142))

It was discovered that the devtools subsystem in Blink mishandles various parameters. An attacker could exploit this to bypass intended access restrictions. ([CVE-2016-5144](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5143">CVE-2016-5143</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5144))

It was discovered that Blink does not ensure that a taint property is preserved after a structure-clone operation on an ImageBitmap object derived from a cross-origin image. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2016-5145](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5145))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5167](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5146">CVE-2016-5146</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5167))

It was discovered that Blink mishandles deferred page loads. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2016-5147](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5147))

An issue was discovered in Blink related to widget updates. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2016-5148](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5148))

A use-after-free was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5150](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5150))

A use-after-free was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5153](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5153))

It was discovered that Chromium does not correctly validate access to the initial document. An attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the currently displayed URL. ([CVE-2016-5155](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5155))

A use-after-free was discovered in the event bindings in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5156](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5156))

A type confusion bug was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5161](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5161))

An issue was discovered with the devtools implementation. An attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2016-5164](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5164))

An issue was discovered with the devtools implementation. An attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2016-5165](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5165))
