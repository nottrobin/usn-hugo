### linux-lts-utopic vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-utopic 

### Details

 A race condition was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s file_handle size verification. A local user could exploit this flaw to read potentially sensative memory locations. ([CVE-2015-1420](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1420))

A underflow error was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s Ozmo Devices USB over WiFi host controller driver. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code via a specially crafted packet. ([CVE-2015-4001](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-4001))

A bounds check error was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s Ozmo Devices USB over WiFi host controller driver. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially execute arbitrary code via a specially crafted packet. ([CVE-2015-4002](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-4002))

A division by zero error was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s Ozmo Devices USB over WiFi host controller driver. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-4003](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-4003))

Carl H Lunde discovered missing sanity checks in the Linux kernel&#39;s UDF file system (CONFIG_UDF_FS). A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) by using a corrupted file system image. ([CVE-2015-4167](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-4167))

Daniel Borkmann reported a kernel crash in the Linux kernel&#39;s BPF filter JIT optimization. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-4700](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-4700))

A double free flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s path lookup. A local user could cause a denial of service (Oops). ([CVE-2015-5706](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-5706)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
