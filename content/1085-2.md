We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Sauli Pahlman discovered that the TIFF library incorrectly handled invalid td_stripbytecount fields. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted TIFF image, a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and 10.10. ([CVE-2011-0191](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2482">CVE-2010-2482</a>) Sauli Pahlman discovered that the TIFF library incorrectly handled TIFF files with an invalid combination of SamplesPerPixel and Photometric values. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted TIFF image, a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.10. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-2482">CVE-2010-2482</a>) Nicolae Ghimbovschi discovered that the TIFF library incorrectly handled invalid ReferenceBlackWhite values.
