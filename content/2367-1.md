title: "USN-2367-1: OpenSSL update"
series: [ ubuntu-12.04-lts]
date: 2014-10-02 12:00:00
description: |
    For compatibility reasons, OpenSSL in Ubuntu 12.04 LTS disables TLSv1.2 by default when being used as a client. When forcing the use of TLSv1.2, another compatibility feature (OPENSSL_MAX_TLS1_2_CIPHER_LENGTH) was used that would truncate the cipher list. This would prevent certain ciphers from being selected, and would prevent secure renegotiations. This update removes the cipher list truncation workaround when forcing the use of TLSv1.2.
