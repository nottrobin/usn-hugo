### libpng vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 7.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* libpng 

### Details

It was discovered that libpng did not properly perform bounds checking in certain operations. An attacker could send a specially crafted PNG image and cause a denial of service in applications linked against libpng. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2007-5269](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-5268">CVE-2007-5268</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-5269))

Tavis Ormandy discovered that libpng did not properly initialize memory. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted PNG image, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue did not affect Ubuntu 8.10. ([CVE-2008-1382](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-1382))

Harald van Dijk discovered an off-by-one error in libpng. An attacker could could cause an application crash in programs using pngtest. ([CVE-2008-3964](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3964))

It was discovered that libpng did not properly NULL terminate a keyword string. An attacker could exploit this to set arbitrary memory locations to zero. ([CVE-2008-5907](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5907))

Glenn Randers-Pehrson discovered that libpng did not properly initialize pointers. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted PNG file, an attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-0040](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0040))
