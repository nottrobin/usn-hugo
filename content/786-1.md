    Matthew Palmer discovered an underflow flaw in apr-util. An attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash in Apache using a crafted SVNMasterURI directive, .htaccess file, or when using mod_apreq2. Applications using libapreq2 are also affected. ([CVE-2009-0023](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0023))

### apr-util vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 9.04
* Ubuntu 8.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Software description

* apr-util 

### Details

Matthew Palmer discovered an underflow flaw in apr-util. An attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash in Apache using a crafted SVNMasterURI directive, .htaccess file, or when using mod_apreq2. Applications using libapreq2 are also affected. ([CVE-2009-0023](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0023))

It was discovered that the XML parser did not properly handle entity expansion. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service via memory resource consumption by sending a crafted request to an Apache server configured to use mod_dav or mod_dav_svn. ([CVE-2009-1955](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1955))

C. Michael Pilato discovered an off-by-one buffer overflow in apr-util when formatting certain strings. For big-endian machines (powerpc, hppa and sparc in Ubuntu), a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or information disclosure leak. All other architectures for Ubuntu are not considered to be at risk. ([CVE-2009-1956](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1956)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 9.04
 : [libaprutil1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apr-util) <span> [1.2.12+dfsg-8ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apr-util/1.2.12+dfsg-8ubuntu0.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 8.10
 : [libaprutil1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apr-util) <span> [1.2.12+dfsg-7ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apr-util/1.2.12+dfsg-7ubuntu0.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
 : [libaprutil1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apr-util) <span> [1.2.12+dfsg-3ubuntu0.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/apr-util/1.2.12+dfsg-3ubuntu0.1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart any services that use apr-util, such as Apache or svnserve, to effect the necessary changes.
