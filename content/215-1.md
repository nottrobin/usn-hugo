description: |
    Thomas Wolff and Miloslav Trmac discovered a race condition in the fetchmailconf program. The output configuration file was initially created with insecure permissions, and secure permissions were applied after writing the configuration into the file. During this time, the file was world readable on a standard system (unless the user manually tightened his umask setting), which could expose email passwords to local users.
