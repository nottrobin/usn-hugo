### firefox vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 13.04
* Ubuntu 12.10
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Firefox could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened a malicious website.

### Software description

* firefox 

### Details

Multiple memory safety issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-1719](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1718">CVE-2013-1718</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1719))

Atte Kettunen discovered a flaw in the HTML5 Tree Builder when interacting with template elements. In some circumstances, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-1720](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1720))

Alex Chapman discovered an integer overflow vulnerability in the ANGLE library. An attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-1721](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1721))

Abhishek Arya discovered a use-after-free in the Animation Manager. An attacked could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-1722](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1722))

Scott Bell discovered a use-after-free when using a select element. An attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-1724](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1724))

It was discovered that the scope of new Javascript objects could be accessed before their compartment is initialized. An attacker could potentially exploit this to execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-1725](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1725))

Dan Gohman discovered that some variables and data were used in IonMonkey, without being initialized, which could lead to information leakage. ([CVE-2013-1728](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1728))

Sachin Shinde discovered a crash when moving some XBL-backed nodes in to a document created by document.open(). An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-1730](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1730))

Aki Helin discovered a buffer overflow when combining lists, floats and multiple columns. An attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-1732](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1732))

Two memory corruption bugs when scrolling were discovered. An attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-1736](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1735">CVE-2013-1735</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1736))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that user-defined getters on DOM proxies would use the expando object as &quot;this&quot;. An attacker could potentially exploit this by tricking add-on code in to making incorrect security sensitive decisions based on malicious values. ([CVE-2013-1737](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1737))

A use-after-free bug was discovered in Firefox. An attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-1738](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1738)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 13.04
 : [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox) <span> [24.0+build1-0ubuntu0.13.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox/24.0+build1-0ubuntu0.13.04.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 12.10
 : [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox) <span> [24.0+build1-0ubuntu0.12.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox/24.0+build1-0ubuntu0.12.10.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox) <span> [24.0+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox/24.0+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to restart Firefox to make all the necessary changes.
