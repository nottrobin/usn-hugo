### linux-lts-backport-maverick vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Multiple kernel flaws have been fixed. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-backport-maverick 

### Details

 Ryan Sweat discovered that the kernel incorrectly handled certain VLAN packets. On some systems, a remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1576](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1576))

Timo Warns discovered that the EFI GUID partition table was not correctly parsed. A physically local attacker that could insert mountable devices could exploit this to crash the system or possibly gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-1776](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1776))

Vasiliy Kulikov and Dan Rosenberg discovered that ecryptfs did not correctly check the origin of mount points. A local attacker could exploit this to trick the system into unmounting arbitrary mount points, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1833](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1833))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the IPv4 diagnostic routines did not correctly validate certain requests. A local attacker could exploit this to consume CPU resources, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2213](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2213))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the Bluetooth stack incorrectly handled certain L2CAP requests. If a system was using Bluetooth, a remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic to crash the system or gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-2497](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2497))

Fernando Gont discovered that the IPv6 stack used predictable fragment identification numbers. A remote attacker could exploit this to exhaust network resources, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2699](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2699))

Mauro Carvalho Chehab discovered that the si4713 radio driver did not correctly check the length of memory copies. If this hardware was available, a local attacker could exploit this to crash the system or gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-2700](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2700))

Herbert Xu discovered that certain fields were incorrectly handled when Generic Receive Offload ([CVE-2011-2723](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2723))

The performance counter subsystem did not correctly handle certain counters. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2918](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2918))

Time Warns discovered that long symlinks were incorrectly handled on Be filesystems. A local attacker could exploit this with a malformed Be filesystem and crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2928](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2928))

Darren Lavender discovered that the CIFS client incorrectly handled certain large values. A remote attacker with a malicious server could exploit this to crash the system or possibly execute arbitrary code as the root user. ([CVE-2011-3191](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3191))

Gideon Naim discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s handling VLAN 0 frames. An attacker on the local network could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-3593](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3593))
