    Recently, Trustix Secure Linux discovered some vulnerabilities in the perl package. The utility &quot;instmodsh&quot;, the Perl package &quot;PPPort.pm&quot;, and several test scripts (which are not shipped and only used during build) created temporary files in an insecure way, which could allow a symlink attack to create or overwrite arbitrary files with the privileges of the user invoking the program, or building the perl package, respectively.
