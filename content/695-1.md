    Paul Szabo discovered a race condition in login.  While setting up tty permissions, login did not correctly handle symlinks.  If a local attacker were able to gain control of the system utmp file, they could cause login to change the ownership and permissions on arbitrary files, leading to a root privilege escalation.
