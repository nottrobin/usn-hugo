description: |
    It was discovered that OpenLDAP did not properly check forwarded authentication failures when using a slave server and chain overlay. If OpenLDAP were configured in this manner, an attacker could bypass authentication checks by sending an invalid password to a slave server.

### openldap, openldap2.3 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.10
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 9.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Summary

An attacker could send crafted input to OpenLDAP and cause it to crash. 

### Software description

* openldap 

* openldap2.3 

### Details

It was discovered that OpenLDAP did not properly check forwarded authentication failures when using a slave server and chain overlay. If OpenLDAP were configured in this manner, an attacker could bypass authentication checks by sending an invalid password to a slave server. ([CVE-2011-1024](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1024))

It was discovered that OpenLDAP did not properly perform authentication checks to the rootdn when using the back-ndb backend. An attacker could exploit this to access the directory by sending an arbitrary password. Ubuntu does not ship OpenLDAP with back-ndb support by default. This issue did not affect Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2011-1025](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1025))

It was discovered that OpenLDAP did not properly validate modrdn requests. An unauthenticated remote user could use this to cause a denial of service via application crash. ([CVE-2011-1081](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1081))
