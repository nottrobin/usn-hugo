### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

 Ben Hutchings reported a flaw in the Linux kernel with some network drivers that support TSO (TCP segment offload). A local or peer user could exploit this flaw to to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-3412](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3412))

Jay Fenlason and Doug Ledford discovered a bug in the Linux kernel implementation of RDS sockets. A local unprivileged user could potentially use this flaw to read privileged information from the kernel. ([CVE-2012-3430](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3430))

Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel&#39;s TUN/TAP device driver. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine part of the kernel&#39;s stack memory. ([CVE-2012-6547](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-6547))

A flaw was discovered in the requeuing of futexes in the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have other unspecified impact. ([CVE-2012-6647](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-6647))

A flaw was found in Linux kernel&#39;s validation of CIPSO (Common IP Security Option) options set from userspace. A local user that can set a socket&#39;s CIPSO options could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash the system). ([CVE-2013-0310](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0310)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-1419-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [3.2.0-1419.26](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1419.26) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
