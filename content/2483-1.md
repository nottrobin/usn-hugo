    Jose Duart discovered that JasPer incorrectly handled ICC color profiles in JPEG-2000 image files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted JPEG-2000 image file, a remote attacker could cause JasPer to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges.

### Details

Jose Duart discovered that JasPer incorrectly handled ICC color profiles in JPEG-2000 image files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted JPEG-2000 image file, a remote attacker could cause JasPer to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2014-8137](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8137))

Jose Duart discovered that JasPer incorrectly decoded certain malformed JPEG-2000 image files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted JPEG-2000 image file, a remote attacker could cause JasPer to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2014-8138](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8138))

It was discovered that JasPer incorrectly handled certain malformed JPEG-2000 image files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted JPEG-2000 image file, a remote attacker could cause JasPer to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2014-8157](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8157))

It was discovered that JasPer incorrectly handled memory when processing JPEG-2000 image files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted JPEG-2000 image file, a remote attacker could cause JasPer to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2014-8158](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8158))
