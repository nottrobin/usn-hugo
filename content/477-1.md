    Wei Wang discovered that the krb5 RPC library did not correctly handle certain error conditions.  A remote attacker could cause kadmind to free an uninitialized pointer, leading to a denial of service or possibly execution of arbitrary code with root privileges.

### krb5 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 7.04
* Ubuntu 6.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Details

Wei Wang discovered that the krb5 RPC library did not correctly handle certain error conditions. A remote attacker could cause kadmind to free an uninitialized pointer, leading to a denial of service or possibly execution of arbitrary code with root privileges. ([CVE-2007-2442](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2442))

Wei Wang discovered that the krb5 RPC library did not correctly check the size of certain communications. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted request to kadmind and execute arbitrary code with root privileges. ([CVE-2007-2443](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2443))

It was discovered that the kadmind service could be made to overflow its stack. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted request and execute arbitrary code with root privileges. ([CVE-2007-2798](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2798))
