### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.10

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

 Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel&#39;s UDF file system implementation. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine some of the kernel&#39;s heap memory. ([CVE-2012-6548](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-6548))

Mathias Krause discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel&#39;s ISO 9660 CDROM file system driver. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine some of the kernel&#39;s heap memory. ([CVE-2012-6549](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-6549))

An integer overflow was discovered in the Direct Rendering Manager (DRM) subsystem for the i915 video driver in the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash) or potentially escalate privileges. ([CVE-2013-0913](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0913))

Andrew Honig discovered a flaw in guest OS time updates in the Linux kernel&#39;s KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine). A privileged guest user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash host system) or potential escalate privilege to the host kernel level. ([CVE-2013-1796](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1796))

Andrew Honig discovered a use after free error in guest OS time updates in the Linux kernel&#39;s KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine). A privileged guest user could exploit this flaw to escalate privilege to the host kernel level. ([CVE-2013-1797](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1797))

Andrew Honig reported a flaw in the way KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) emulated the IOAPIC. A privileged guest user could exploit this flaw to read host memory or cause a denial of service (crash the host). ([CVE-2013-1798](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1798))

A format-string bug was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s ext3 filesystem driver. A local user could exploit this flaw to possibly escalate privileges on the system. ([CVE-2013-1848](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1848))

A buffer overflow was discovered in the Linux Kernel&#39;s USB subsystem for devices reporting the cdc-wdm class. A specially crafted USB device when plugged-in could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2013-1860](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1860))

A flaw was discovered in the SCTP (stream control transfer protocol) network protocol&#39;s handling of duplicate cookies in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) on another remote user querying the SCTP connection. ([CVE-2013-2206](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2206))

An information leak in the Linux kernel&#39;s dcb netlink interface was discovered. A local user could obtain sensitive information by examining kernel stack memory. ([CVE-2013-2634](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2634))

A kernel stack information leak was discovered in the RTNETLINK component of the Linux kernel. A local user could read sensitive information from the kernel stack. ([CVE-2013-2635](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2635)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.10
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-28-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-28.48](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-28.48) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-28-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-28.48](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-28.48) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-28-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-28.48](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-28.48) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-28-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-28.48](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-28.48) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-28-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-28.48](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-28.48) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
