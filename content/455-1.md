### php5 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 7.04
* Ubuntu 6.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Details

Stefan Esser discovered multiple vulnerabilities in the &quot;Month of PHP bugs&quot;.

The substr_compare() function did not sufficiently verify its length argument. This might be exploited to read otherwise unaccessible memory, which might lead to information disclosure. ([CVE-2007-1375](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-1375))

The shared memory (shmop) functions did not verify resource types, thus they could be called with a wrong resource type that might contain user supplied data. This could be exploited to read and write arbitrary memory addresses of the PHP interpreter. This issue does not affect Ubuntu 7.04. ([CVE-2007-1376](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-1376))

The php_binary handler of the session extension was missing a boundary check. When unserializing overly long variable names this could be exploited to read up to 126 bytes of memory, which might lead to information disclosure. ([CVE-2007-1380](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-1380))

The internal array_user_key_compare() function, as used for example by the PHP function uksort(), incorrectly handled memory unreferencing of its arguments. This could have been exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the PHP interpreter, and thus circumventing any disable_functions, open_basedir, or safe_mode restrictions. ([CVE-2007-1484](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-1484))

The session_regenerate_id() function did not properly clean up the former session identifier variable. This could be exploited to crash the PHP interpreter, possibly also remotely. ([CVE-2007-1521](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-1521))

Under certain conditions the mb_parse_str() could cause the register_globals configuration option to become permanently enabled. This opened an attack vector for a large and common class of vulnerabilities. ([CVE-2007-1583](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-1583))

The session extension did not set the correct reference count value for the session variables. By unsetting _SESSION and HTTP_SESSION_VARS (or tricking a PHP script into doing that) this could be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the PHP interpreter. This issue does not affect Ubuntu 7.04. ([CVE-2007-1700](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-1700))

The mail() function did not correctly escape control characters in multiline email headers. This could be remotely exploited to inject arbitrary email headers. ([CVE-2007-1718](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-1718))

The php_stream_filter_create() function had an off-by-one buffer overflow in the handling of wildcards. This could be exploited to remotely crash the PHP interpreter. This issue does not affect Ubuntu 7.04. ([CVE-2007-1824](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-1824))

When calling the sqlite_udf_decode_binary() with special arguments, a buffer overflow happened. Depending on the application this could be locally or remotely exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the PHP interpreter. ([CVE-2007-1888](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-1887">CVE-2007-1887</a> <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-1888))

The FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL filter extension used a wrong regular expression that allowed injecting a newline character at the end of the email string. This could be exploited to inject arbitrary email headers. This issue only affects Ubuntu 7.04. ([CVE-2007-1900](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-1900))

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 7.04
 : php5-cli <span>5.2.1-0ubuntu1.1</span>
 : php5-cgi <span>5.2.1-0ubuntu1.1</span>
 : libapache2-mod-php5 <span>5.2.1-0ubuntu1.1</span>
 : php5-sqlite <span>5.2.1-0ubuntu1.1</span>

Ubuntu 6.10
 : php5-cli <span>5.1.6-1ubuntu2.4</span>
 : php5-cgi <span>5.1.6-1ubuntu2.4</span>
 : libapache2-mod-php5 <span>5.1.6-1ubuntu2.4</span>
 : php5-sqlite <span>5.1.6-1ubuntu2.4</span>

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : php5-cli <span>5.1.2-1ubuntu3.7</span>
 : php5-cgi <span>5.1.2-1ubuntu3.7</span>
 : libapache2-mod-php5 <span>5.1.2-1ubuntu3.7</span>
 : php5-sqlite <span>5.1.2-1ubuntu3.7</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the necessary changes.
