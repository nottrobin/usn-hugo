### Details

The Fix for [CVE-2015-1328](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1328) introduced a regression into the Linux kernel&#39;s overlayfs file system. The removal of a directory that only exists on the lower layer results in a kernel panic.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Philip Pettersson discovered a privilege escalation when using overlayfs mounts inside of user namespaces. A local user could exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges on the system.
