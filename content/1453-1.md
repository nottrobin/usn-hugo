### linux-ec2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ec2 

### Details

A flaw was found in the Linux&#39;s kernels ext4 file system when mounted with a journal. A local, unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-4086](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4086))

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel&#39;s KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) virtual cpu setup. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to crash the system leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-1601](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1601))

Steve Grubb reported a flaw with Linux fscaps (file system base capabilities) when used to increase the permissions of a process. For application on which fscaps are in use a local attacker can disable address space randomization to make attacking the process with raised privileges easier. ([CVE-2012-2123](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2123)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:
