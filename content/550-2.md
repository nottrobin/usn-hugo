### libcairo regression

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 7.10
* Ubuntu 7.04

### Software description

* libcairo 

### Details

USN-550-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Cairo. The upstream fixes were incomplete, and under certain situations, applications using Cairo would crash with a floating point error. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Peter Valchev discovered that Cairo did not correctly decode PNG image data. By tricking a user or automated system into processing a specially crafted PNG with Cairo, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with user privileges. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 7.10
 : [libcairo2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libcairo) <span> [1.4.10-1ubuntu4.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libcairo/1.4.10-1ubuntu4.2) </span> 

Ubuntu 7.04
 : [libcairo2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libcairo) <span> [1.4.2-0ubuntu1.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libcairo/1.4.2-0ubuntu1.2) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart your session to effect the necessary changes.
