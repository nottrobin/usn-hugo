### Details

It was discovered that the Tomcat XML parser incorrectly handled XML External Entities (XXE). A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to read arbitrary files. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-0119](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-0119))

It was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly handled data with malformed chunked transfer coding. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to conduct HTTP request smuggling attacks, or cause Tomcat to consume resources, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-0227](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-0227))

It was discovered that Tomcat incorrectly handled HTTP responses occurring before the entire request body was finished being read. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a limited denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-0230](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-0230))

It was discovered that the Tomcat Expression Language (EL) implementation incorrectly handled accessible interfaces implemented by inaccessible classes. An attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass a SecurityManager protection mechanism. ([CVE-2014-7810](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-7810))
