    Jesse Ruderman, Mats Palmgren, Byron Campen, Steve Fink, Gary Kwong, Andrew McCreight, Christian Holler, Jon Coppeard, and Milan Sreckovic discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.
