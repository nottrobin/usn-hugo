Original advisory details:

 If was discovered that Firefox could be made to access freed memory. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2008-5913](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1121">CVE-2010-1121</a>) Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine of Firefox. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1200">CVE-2010-1200</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1201">CVE-2010-1201</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1202">CVE-2010-1202</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1203">CVE-2010-1203</a>) A flaw was discovered in the way plugin instances interacted. An attacker could potentially exploit this and use one plugin to access freed memory from a second plugin to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1198">CVE-2010-1198</a>) An integer overflow was discovered in Firefox. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, an attacker could overflow a buffer and cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1196">CVE-2010-1196</a>) Martin Barbella discovered an integer overflow in an XSLT node sorting routine. An attacker could exploit this to overflow a buffer and cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1199">CVE-2010-1199</a>) Michal Zalewski discovered that the focus behavior of Firefox could be subverted. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could use this to capture keystrokes. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1125">CVE-2010-1125</a>) Ilja van Sprundel discovered that the &#39;Content-Disposition: attachment&#39; HTTP header was ignored when &#39;Content-Type: multipart&#39; was also present. Under certain circumstances, this could potentially lead to cross-site scripting attacks. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1197">CVE-2010-1197</a>) Amit Klein discovered that Firefox did not seed its random number generator often enough. An attacker could exploit this to identify and track users across different web sites. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5913))
