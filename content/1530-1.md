### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.04

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

Andy Adamson discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s NFSv4 implementation. A remote NFS server (attacker) could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-4131](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4131))

Steve Grubb reported a flaw with Linux fscaps (file system base capabilities) when used to increase the permissions of a process. For application on which fscaps are in use a local attacker can disable address space randomization to make attacking the process with raised privileges easier. ([CVE-2012-2123](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2123))

An error was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s network TUN/TAP device implementation. A local user with access to the TUN/TAP interface (which is not available to unprivileged users until granted by a root user) could exploit this flaw to crash the system or potential gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2012-2136](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2136))

Stephan Mueller reported a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s dl2k network driver&#39;s handling of ioctls. An unprivileged local user could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-2313](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2313))

Timo Warns reported multiple flaws in the Linux kernel&#39;s hfsplus filesystem. An unprivileged local user could exploit these flaws to gain root system priviliges. ([CVE-2012-2319](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2319))

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel&#39;s Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol implementation. A local, unprivileged user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-2372](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2372))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s NFSv4 (Network file system) handling of ACLs (access control lists). A remote NFS server (attacker) could cause a denial of service (OOPS). ([CVE-2012-2375](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2375)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 11.04
 : [linux-image-2.6.38-1209-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [2.6.38-1209.25](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/2.6.38-1209.25) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.
