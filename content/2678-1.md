### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

A flaw was discovered in the user space memory copying for the pipe iovecs in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or potentially escalate their privileges. ([CVE-2015-1805](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1805))

Daniel Borkmann reported a kernel crash in the Linux kernel&#39;s BPF filter JIT optimization. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-4700](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-4700)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-88-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-88.126](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-88.126) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-88-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-88.126](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-88.126) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-88-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-88.126](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-88.126) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-88-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-88.126](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-88.126) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-88-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-88.126](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-88.126) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-88-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-88.126](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-88.126) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-88-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.2.0-88.126](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.2.0-88.126) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
