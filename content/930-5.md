Original advisory details:

 If was discovered that Firefox could be made to access freed memory. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2010-2754](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-1121">CVE-2010-1121</a>) Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine of Firefox. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious site, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.
