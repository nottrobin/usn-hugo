description: |
    Thomas Pollet discovered that CUPS did not properly validate the size of PNG images. A local attacker, and a remote attacker if printer sharing is enabled, could send a crafted file and cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code as the non-root user in Ubuntu 6.06 LTS and 7.04. In Ubuntu 7.10, attackers would be isolated by the AppArmor CUPS profile. ([CVE-2008-1722](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-1722))
