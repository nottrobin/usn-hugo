    A buffer overflow was found in the KDE libraries when converting a string to a floating point number. If a user or application linked against kdelibs were tricked into processing crafted input, an attacker could cause a denial of service (via application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

### kdelibs vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 9.10
* Ubuntu 9.04
* Ubuntu 8.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Software description

* kdelibs 

### Details

A buffer overflow was found in the KDE libraries when converting a string to a floating point number. If a user or application linked against kdelibs were tricked into processing crafted input, an attacker could cause a denial of service (via application crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-0689](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0689))

It was discovered that the KDE libraries could use KHTML to process an unknown MIME type. If a user or application linked against kdelibs were tricked into opening a crafted file, an attacker could potentially trigger XMLHTTPRequests to remote sites.
