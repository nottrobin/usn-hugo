### linux-mvl-dove vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.10

### Summary

The system could be made to crash or run programs as an administrator. 

### Software description

* linux-mvl-dove 

### Details

A flaw was discovered in the XFS filesystem. If a local user mounts a specially crafted XFS image it could potential execute arbitrary code on the system. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.10
 : [linux-image-2.6.32-423-dove](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-mvl-dove) <span> [2.6.32-423.42](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-mvl-dove/2.6.32-423.42) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
