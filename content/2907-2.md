### linux-lts-trusty vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-trusty 

### Details

halfdog discovered that OverlayFS, when mounting on top of a FUSE mount, incorrectly propagated file attributes, including setuid. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to gain privileges. ([CVE-2016-1576](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1576))

halfdog discovered that OverlayFS in the Linux kernel incorrectly propagated security sensitive extended attributes, such as POSIX ACLs. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to gain privileges. ([CVE-2016-1575](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1575))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel keyring subsystem contained a race between read and revoke operations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-7550](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7550))

郭永刚 discovered that the Linux kernel networking implementation did not validate protocol identifiers for certain protocol families, A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2015-8543](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8543))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the pptp implementation in the Linux kernel did not verify an address length when setting up a socket. A local attacker could use this to craft an application that exposed sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2015-8569](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8569))

David Miller discovered that the Bluetooth implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly validate the socket address length for Synchronous Connection-Oriented (SCO) sockets. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2015-8575](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8575))

It was discovered that the Linux kernel&#39;s Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) implementation did not handle initial zero length segments properly. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (unkillable task). ([CVE-2015-8785](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8785)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-79-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty) <span> [3.13.0-79.123~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-79.123~precise1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-79-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty) <span> [3.13.0-79.123~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-79.123~precise1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
