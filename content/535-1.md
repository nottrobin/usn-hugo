* Ubuntu 6.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* firefox 

### Details

Various flaws were discovered in the layout and JavaScript engines. By tricking a user into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2007-5340](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-5336">CVE-2007-5336</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-5339">CVE-2007-5339</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-5340))

Michal Zalewski discovered that the onUnload event handlers were incorrectly able to access information outside the old page content. A malicious web site could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data (such as passwords), of the next loaded web page. ([CVE-2007-1095](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-1095))

Stefano Di Paola discovered that Firefox did not correctly request Digest Authentications. A malicious web site could exploit this to inject arbitrary HTTP headers or perform session splitting attacks against proxies. ([CVE-2007-2292](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2292))

Flaws were discovered in the file upload form control. By tricking a user into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could force arbitrary files from the user&#39;s computer to be uploaded without their consent. ([CVE-2007-3511](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-2894">CVE-2006-2894</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-3511))

Eli Friedman discovered that XUL could be used to hide a window&#39;s titlebar. A malicious web site could exploit this to enhance their attempts at creating phishing web sites. ([CVE-2007-5334](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-5334))

Georgi Guninski discovered that Firefox would allow file-system based web pages to access additional files. By tricking a user into opening a malicious web page from a gnome-vfs location, an attacker could steal arbitrary files from the user&#39;s computer. ([CVE-2007-5337](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-5337))

It was discovered that the XPCNativeWrappers were not safe in certain situations. By tricking a user into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could run arbitrary JavaScript with the user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2007-5338](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-5338))
