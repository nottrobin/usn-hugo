### Software description

* openoffice.org 

### Details

A stack-based buffer overflow was discovered in the Lotus Word Pro import filter in OpenOffice.org. The default compiler options for affected releases should reduce the vulnerability to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2685](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2685))

Huzaifa Sidhpurwala discovered that OpenOffice.org could be made to crash if it opened a specially crafted Word document. ([CVE-2011-2713](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2713))

Integer overflows were discovered in the graphics loading code of several different image types. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted file, an attacker could cause OpenOffice.org to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-1149](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1149))

Sven Jacobi discovered an integer overflow when processing Escher graphics records. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted PowerPoint file, an attacker could cause OpenOffice.org to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-2334](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2334))
