description: |
    Hadmut Danish discovered an information disclosure vulnerability in the key selection dialog of the Mozilla/Thunderbird enigmail plugin. If a user&#39;s keyring contained a key with an empty user id (i. e. a key without a name and email address), this key was selected by default when the user attempted to send an encrypted email. Unless this empty key was manually deselected, the message got encrypted for that empty key, whose owner could then decrypt it.
