    Ondrej Kozina discovered that the keyring interface in the Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow when displaying timeout events via the /proc/keys interface. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-7042](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-7042))

### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

Ondrej Kozina discovered that the keyring interface in the Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow when displaying timeout events via the /proc/keys interface. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-7042](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-7042))

Dmitry Vyukov discovered a use-after-free vulnerability during error processing in the recvmmsg(2) implementation in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-7117](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-7117)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [3.2.0.1493.88](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1493.120) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-1493-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [3.2.0-1493.120](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1493.120) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
