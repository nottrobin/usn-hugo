### imagemagick vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

A buffer overflow in imagemagick&#39;s EXIF parsing routine has been discovered in imagemagick versions prior to 6.1.0. Trying to query EXIF information of a malicious image file might result in execution of arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges.

Since imagemagick can be used in custom printing systems, this also might lead to privilege escalation (execute code with the printer spooler&#39;s privileges). However, Ubuntu&#39;s standard printing system does not use imagemagick, thus there is no risk of privilege escalation in a standard installation.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 4.10
 : libmagick6 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

None
