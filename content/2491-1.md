### linux-ec2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ec2 

### Details

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle faults associated with the Stack Segment (SS) register in the x86 architecture. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2014-9322](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-9322))

Lars Bull reported a race condition in the PIT (programmable interrupt timer) emulation in the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local guest user with access to PIT i/o ports could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (crash) on the host. ([CVE-2014-3611](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3611))

Lars Bull and Nadav Amit reported a flaw in how KVM (the Kernel Virtual Machine) handles noncanonical writes to certain MSR registers. A privileged guest user can exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel panic) on the host. ([CVE-2014-3610](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3610))

Andy Lutomirski discovered an information leak in the Linux kernel&#39;s Thread Local Storage (TLS) implementation allowing users to bypass the espfix to obtain information that could be used to bypass the Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) protection mechanism. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-8133](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8133))

Prasad J Pandit reported a flaw in the rock_continue function of the Linux kernel&#39;s ISO 9660 CDROM file system. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash or hang). ([CVE-2014-9420](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-9420)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-2.6.32-375-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2) <span> [2.6.32-375.92](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2/2.6.32-375.92) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
