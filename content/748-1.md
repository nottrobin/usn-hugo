### openjdk-6 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.10

### Software description

* openjdk-6 

### Details

It was discovered that font creation could leak temporary files. If a user were tricked into loading a malicious program or applet, a remote attacker could consume disk space, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-1100](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-2426">CVE-2006-2426</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1100))

It was discovered that the lightweight HttpServer did not correctly close files on dataless connections. A remote attacker could send specially crafted requests, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-1101](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1101))

The Java Runtime Environment did not correctly validate certain generated code. If a user were tricked into running a malicious applet a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2009-1102](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1102))

It was discovered that LDAP connections did not close correctly. A remote attacker could send specially crafted requests, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-1093](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1093))

Java LDAP routines did not unserialize certain data correctly. A remote attacker could send specially crafted requests that could lead to arbitrary code execution. ([CVE-2009-1094](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1094))

Java did not correctly check certain JAR headers. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a malicious JAR file, a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-1096](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1095">CVE-2009-1095</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1096))

It was discovered that PNG and GIF decoding in Java could lead to memory corruption. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted image, a remote attacker could crash the application, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2009-1098](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1097">CVE-2009-1097</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1098)) 

### Update instructions
