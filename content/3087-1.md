### openssl vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in OpenSSL. 

### Software description

* openssl 

### Details

Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled the OCSP Status Request extension. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause memory consumption, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-6304](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-6304))

Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL used undefined behaviour when performing pointer arithmetic. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue has only been addressed in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS in this update. ([CVE-2016-2177](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2177))

CÃ©sar Pereida, Billy Brumley, and Yuval Yarom discovered that OpenSSL did not properly use constant-time operations when performing DSA signing. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform a cache-timing attack and recover private DSA keys. ([CVE-2016-2178](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2178))

Quan Luo discovered that OpenSSL did not properly restrict the lifetime of queue entries in the DTLS implementation. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to consume memory, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2179](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2179))

Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory in the TS_OBJ_print_bio() function. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2180](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2180))

It was discovered that the OpenSSL incorrectly handled the DTLS anti-replay feature. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2181](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2181))

Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly validated division results. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2182](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2182))

Karthik Bhargavan and Gaetan Leurent discovered that the DES and Triple DES ciphers were vulnerable to birthday attacks. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to obtain clear text data from long encrypted sessions. This update moves DES from the HIGH cipher list to MEDIUM. ([CVE-2016-2183](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2183))

Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain ticket lengths. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-6302](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-6302))

Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory in the MDC2_Update() function. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-6303](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-6303))

Shi Lei discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly performed certain message length checks. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-6306](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-6306)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
 : [libssl1.0.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl) <span> [1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/1.0.2g-1ubuntu4.4) </span> 

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 : [libssl1.0.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl) <span> [1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.20](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.20) </span> 

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [libssl1.0.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl) <span> [1.0.1-4ubuntu5.37](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/1.0.1-4ubuntu5.37) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.
