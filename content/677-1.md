### Details

Multiple memory overflow flaws were discovered in OpenOffice.org&#39;s handling of WMF and EMF files. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted document, a remote attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-2238](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2237">CVE-2008-2237</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2238))

Dmitry E. Oboukhov discovered that senddoc, as included in OpenOffice.org, created temporary files in an insecure way. Local users could exploit a race condition to create or overwrite files with the privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2008-4937](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4937))
