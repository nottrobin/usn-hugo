    Bobby Holley discovered vulnerabilities in Chrome Object Wrappers (COW) and System Only Wrappers (SOW). If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page and had scripting enabled, a remote attacker could exploit this to bypass security protections to obtain sensitive information or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.

### thunderbird vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.10
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 11.10
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird. 

### Software description

* thunderbird 

### Details

Bobby Holley discovered vulnerabilities in Chrome Object Wrappers (COW) and System Only Wrappers (SOW). If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page and had scripting enabled, a remote attacker could exploit this to bypass security protections to obtain sensitive information or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-0773](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0773))

Frederik Braun discovered that Thunderbird made the location of the active browser profile available to JavaScript workers. Scripting for Thunderbird is disabled by default in Ubuntu. ([CVE-2013-0774](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0774))

A use-after-free vulnerability was discovered in Thunderbird. An attacker could potentially exploit this to execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird if scripting were enabled. ([CVE-2013-0775](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0775))

Michal Zalewski discovered that Thunderbird would not always show the correct address when cancelling a proxy authentication prompt. A remote attacker could exploit this to conduct URL spoofing and phishing attacks if scripting were enabled. ([CVE-2013-0776](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0776))

Abhishek Arya discovered several problems related to memory handling. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-0782](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0777">CVE-2013-0777</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0778">CVE-2013-0778</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0779">CVE-2013-0779</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0780">CVE-2013-0780</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0781">CVE-2013-0781</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0782))

Olli Pettay, Christoph Diehl, Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Andrew McCreight, Joe Drew, Wayne Mery, Alon Zakai, Christian Holler, Gary Kwong, Luke Wagner, Terrence Cole, Timothy Nikkel, Bill McCloskey, and Nicolas Pierron discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting Thunderbird. If a user had scripting enabled and was tricked into opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash. ([CVE-2013-0784](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0783">CVE-2013-0783</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0784))
