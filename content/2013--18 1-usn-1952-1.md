    Multiple memory safety issues were discovered in Thunderbird.

### thunderbird vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 13.04
* Ubuntu 12.10
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird. 

### Software description

* thunderbird 

### Details

Multiple memory safety issues were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-1718](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1718))

Atte Kettunen discovered a flaw in the HTML5 Tree Builder when interacting with template elements. If a user had scripting enabled, in some circumstances an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-1720](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1720))

Alex Chapman discovered an integer overflow vulnerability in the ANGLE library. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-1721](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1721))

Abhishek Arya discovered a use-after-free in the Animation Manager. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacked could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-1722](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1722))

Scott Bell discovered a use-after-free when using a select element. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-1724](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1724))

It was discovered that the scope of new Javascript objects could be accessed before their compartment is initialized. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-1725](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1725))

Dan Gohman discovered that some variables and data were used in IonMonkey, without being initialized, which could lead to information leakage. ([CVE-2013-1728](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1728))

Sachin Shinde discovered a crash when moving some XBL-backed nodes in to a document created by document.open(). If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-1730](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1730))

Aki Helin discovered a buffer overflow when combining lists, floats and multiple columns. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-1732](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1732))

Two memory corruption bugs when scrolling were discovered. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-1736](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1735">CVE-2013-1735</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1736))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that user-defined getters on DOM proxies would use the expando object as &quot;this&quot;. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this by tricking add-on code in to making incorrect security sensitive decisions based on malicious values. ([CVE-2013-1737](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1737))

A use-after-free bug was discovered in Thunderbird. If a user had scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-1738](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1738)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 13.04
 : [thunderbird](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/thunderbird) <span> [1:24.0+build1-0ubuntu0.13.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/thunderbird/1:24.0+build1-0ubuntu0.13.04.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 12.10
 : [thunderbird](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/thunderbird) <span> [1:24.0+build1-0ubuntu0.12.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/thunderbird/1:24.0+build1-0ubuntu0.12.10.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [thunderbird](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/thunderbird) <span> [1:24.0+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/thunderbird/1:24.0+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to restart Thunderbird to make all the necessary changes.
