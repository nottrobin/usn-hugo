    Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize the Code Segment (CS) in certain error cases. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2016-9756](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-9756))

### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

Dmitry Vyukov discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly initialize the Code Segment (CS) in certain error cases. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2016-9756](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-9756))

Baozeng Ding discovered a race condition that could lead to a use-after- free in the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-9794](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-9794)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [3.2.0.1498.93](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1498.125) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-1498-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [3.2.0-1498.125](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1498.125) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
