### oxide-qt vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Oxide. 

### Software description

* oxide-qt 

### Details

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service (application crash) or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-1705](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1705))

It was discovered that the PPAPI implementation does not validate the origin of IPC messages to the plugin broker process. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass sandbox protection mechanisms. ([CVE-2016-1706](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1706))

It was discovered that Blink does not prevent window creation by a deferred frame. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2016-1710](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1710))

It was discovered that Blink does not disable frame navigation during a detach operation on a DocumentLoader object. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2016-1711](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1711))

A use-after-free was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer process crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5127](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5127))

It was discovered that objects.cc in V8 does not prevent API interceptors from modifying a store target without setting a property. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2016-5128](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5128))

A memory corruption was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer process crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5129](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5129))

A security issue was discovered in Chromium. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof the currently displayed URL. ([CVE-2016-5130](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5130))

A use-after-free was discovered in libxml. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer process crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5131](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5131))

The Service Workers implementation in Chromium does not properly implement the Secure Contexts specification during decisions about whether to control a subframe. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2016-5132](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5132))

It was discovered that Chromium mishandles origin information during proxy authentication. A man-in-the-middle attacker could potentially exploit this to spoof a proxy authentication login prompt. ([CVE-2016-5133](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5133))

It was discovered that the Proxy Auto-Config (PAC) feature in Chromium does not ensure that URL information is restricted to a scheme, host and port. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-5134](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5134))

It was discovered that Blink does not consider referrer-policy information inside an HTML document during a preload request. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass Content Security Policy (CSP) protections. ([CVE-2016-5135](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5135))

It was discovered that the Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation in Blink does not apply http :80 policies to https :443 URLs. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to determine whether a specific HSTS web site has been visited by reading a CSP report. ([CVE-2016-5137](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5137))
