### evolution vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Max Vozeler discovered an integer overflow in camel-lock-helper. An user-supplied length value was not validated, so that a value of -1 caused a buffer allocation of 0 bytes; this buffer was then filled by an arbitrary amount of user-supplied data.

A local attacker or a malicious POP3 server could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with root privileges (because camel-lock-helper is installed as setuid root).

### Update instructions

Ubuntu 4.10
