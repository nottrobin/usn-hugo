### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 15.04

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

It was discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the AF_UNIX implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use crafted epoll_ctl calls to cause a denial of service (system crash) or expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-7446](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-7446))

It was discovered that the KVM implementation in the Linux kernel did not properly restore the values of the Programmable Interrupt Timer (PIT). A user-assisted attacker in a KVM guest could cause a denial of service in the host (system crash). ([CVE-2015-7513](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7513))

Sasha Levin discovered that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) implementation in the Linux kernel had a race condition when checking whether a socket was bound or not. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-7990](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7990))

It was discovered that the Btrfs implementation in the Linux kernel incorrectly handled compressed inline extants on truncation. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2015-8374](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8374))

It was discovered that the netfilter Network Address Translation (NAT) implementation did not ensure that data structures were initialized when handling IPv4 addresses. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2015-8787](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8787)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 15.04
 : [linux-image-3.19.0-49-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.19.0-49.55](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.19.0-49.55) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.19.0-49-powerpc-e500mc](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.19.0-49.55](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.19.0-49.55) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.19.0-49-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.19.0-49.55](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.19.0-49.55) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.19.0-49-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.19.0-49.55](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.19.0-49.55) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.19.0-49-powerpc64-emb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.19.0-49.55](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.19.0-49.55) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.19.0-49-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.19.0-49.55](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.19.0-49.55) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.19.0-49-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.19.0-49.55](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.19.0-49.55) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
