### puppet vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 11.10
* Ubuntu 11.04
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Puppet. 

### Software description

* puppet 

### Details

It was discovered that Puppet incorrectly handled certain HTTP GET requests. An attacker could use this flaw with a valid client certificate to retrieve arbitrary files from the Puppet master. ([CVE-2012-3864](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3864))

It was discovered that Puppet incorrectly handled Delete requests. If a Puppet master were reconfigured to allow the &quot;Delete&quot; method, an attacker on an authenticated host could use this flaw to delete arbitrary files from the Puppet server, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-3865](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3865))

It was discovered that Puppet incorrectly set file permissions on the last_run_report.yaml file. An attacker could use this flaw to access sensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.10 and Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. ([CVE-2012-3866](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3866))

It was discovered that Puppet incorrectly handled agent certificate names. An attacker could use this flaw to create a specially crafted certificate and trick an administrator into signing a certificate that can then be used to man-in-the-middle agent nodes. ([CVE-2012-3867](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3867))
