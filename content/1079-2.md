### openjdk-6b18 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 9.10

### Summary

OpenJDK 6 Vulnerabilities (armel packages only) 

### Software description

* openjdk-6b18 

### Details

USN-1079-1 fixed vulnerabilities in OpenJDK 6 for non-armel (ARM) architectures. This update provides the corresponding updates for OpenJDK 6 for use with the armel (ARM) architectures.

In order to build the armel (ARM) OpenJDK 6 update for Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, it was necessary to rebuild binutils and gcj-4.4 from Ubuntu 10.04 LTS updates.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that untrusted Java applets could create domain name resolution cache entries, allowing an attacker to manipulate name resolution within the JVM. ([CVE-2010-4448](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4448))

 It was discovered that the Java launcher did not did not properly setup the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable. A local attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-4450](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4450))

 It was discovered that within the Swing library, forged timer events could allow bypass of SecurityManager checks. This could allow an attacker to access restricted resources. ([CVE-2010-4465](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4465))

 It was discovered that certain bytecode combinations confused memory management within the HotSpot JVM. This could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service through an application crash or possibly inject code. ([CVE-2010-4469](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4469))

 It was discovered that the way JAXP components were handled allowed them to be manipulated by untrusted applets. An attacker could use this to bypass XML processing restrictions and elevate privileges. ([CVE-2010-4470](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4470))

 It was discovered that the Java2D subcomponent, when processing broken CFF fonts could leak system properties. ([CVE-2010-4471](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4471))

 It was discovered that a flaw in the XML Digital Signature component could allow an attacker to cause untrusted code to replace the XML Digital Signature Transform or C14N algorithm implementations. ([CVE-2010-4472](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4472))

 Konstantin Preisser and others discovered that specific double literals were improperly handled, allowing a remote attacker to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2010-4476](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4476))

 It was discovered that the JNLPClassLoader class when handling multiple signatures allowed remote attackers to gain privileges due to the assignment of an inappropriate security descriptor. ([CVE-2011-0706](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0706))
