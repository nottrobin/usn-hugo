    It was discovered that Pidgin did not properly handle certain malformed messages when sending a file using the XMPP protocol handler. If a user were tricked into sending a file, a remote attacker could send a specially crafted response and cause Pidgin to crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges.
