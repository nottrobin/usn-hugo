### xine-lib vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 7.10
* Ubuntu 7.04
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* xine-lib 

### Details

Alin Rad Pop discovered an array index vulnerability in the SDP parser. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a malicious RTSP stream, a remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-0073](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0073))

Luigi Auriemma discovered that xine-lib did not properly check buffer sizes in the RTSP header-handling code. If xine-lib opened an RTSP stream with crafted SDP attributes, a remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-0238](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0225">CVE-2008-0225</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0238))

Damian Frizza and Alfredo Ortega discovered that xine-lib did not properly validate FLAC tags. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted FLAC file, a remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-0486](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0486))

It was discovered that the ASF demuxer in xine-lib did not properly check the length if the ASF header. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted ASF file, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-1110](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-1110))

It was discovered that the Matroska demuxer in xine-lib did not properly verify frame sizes. If xine-lib opened a crafted ASF file, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-1161](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-1161))

Luigi Auriemma discovered multiple integer overflows in xine-lib. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted FLV, MOV, RM, MVE, MKV or CAK file, a remote attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-1482](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-1482))

It was discovered that xine-lib did not properly validate its input when processing Speex file headers. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted Speex file, an attacker could create a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-1686](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-1686))

Guido Landi discovered a stack-based buffer overflow in xine-lib when processing NSF files. If xine-lib opened a specially crafted NSF file with a long NSF title, an attacker could create a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-1878](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-1878)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
 : [libxine1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xine-lib) <span> [1.1.11.1-1ubuntu3.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xine-lib/1.1.11.1-1ubuntu3.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 7.10
 : [libxine1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xine-lib) <span> [1.1.7-1ubuntu1.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xine-lib/1.1.7-1ubuntu1.3) </span> 

Ubuntu 7.04
 : [libxine-main1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xine-lib) <span> [1.1.4-2ubuntu3.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xine-lib/1.1.4-2ubuntu3.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : [libxine-main1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xine-lib) <span> [1.1.1+ubuntu2-7.9](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xine-lib/1.1.1+ubuntu2-7.9) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart applications linked against xine-lib to effect the necessary changes.
