### mono vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.10
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Mono. 

### Software description

* mono 

### Details

It was discovered that the Mono TLS implementation was vulnerable to the SKIP-TLS vulnerability. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to perform client impersonation attacks. ([CVE-2015-2318](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2318))

It was discovered that the Mono TLS implementation was vulnerable to the FREAK vulnerability. A remote attacker or a man in the middle could possibly use this issue to force the use of insecure ciphersuites. ([CVE-2015-2319](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2319))

It was discovered that the Mono TLS implementation still supported a fallback to SSLv2. This update removes the functionality as use of SSLv2 is known to be insecure. ([CVE-2015-2320](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2320))

It was discovered that Mono incorrectly handled memory in certain circumstances. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Mono to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or to obtain sensitive information. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. ([CVE-2011-0992](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0992))

It was discovered that Mono incorrectly handled hash collisions. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause Mono to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. ([CVE-2012-3543](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3543))
