* Ubuntu 12.10
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 11.10
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Multiple security issues were fixed in Thunderbird. 

### Software description

* thunderbird 

### Details

Gary Kwong, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Bob Clary, Kyle Huey, Ed Morley, Chris Lord, Boris Zbarsky, Julian Seward, Bill McCloskey, and Andrew McCreight discovered several memory corruption flaws in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, an attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5843](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5842">CVE-2012-5842</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5843))

Atte Kettunen discovered a buffer overflow while rendering GIF format images. An attacker could exploit this to possibly execute arbitrary code as the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2012-4202](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4202))

It was discovered that the evalInSandbox function&#39;s JavaScript sandbox context could be circumvented. An attacker could exploit this to perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack or steal a copy of a local file if the user has installed an add-on vulnerable to this attack. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4201](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4201))

Jonathan Stephens discovered that combining vectors involving the setting of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) properties in conjunction with SVG text could cause Thunderbird to crash. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious E-Mail, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privliges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5836](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5836))

Scott Bell discovered a memory corruption issue in the JavaScript engine. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, an attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-4204](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4204))

Gabor Krizsanits discovered that XMLHttpRequest objects created within sandboxes have the system principal instead of the sandbox principal. This can lead to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) or information theft via an add-on running untrusted code in a sandbox. ([CVE-2012-4205](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4205))

Peter Van der Beken discovered XrayWrapper implementation in Firefox does not consider the compartment during property filtering. If JavaScript were enabled, an attacker could use this to bypass intended chrome-only restrictions on reading DOM object properties via a crafted web site. ([CVE-2012-4208](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4208))

Bobby Holley discovered that cross-origin wrappers were allowing write actions on objects when only read actions should have been properly allowed. This can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-5841](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5841))

Masato Kinugawa discovered that when HZ-GB-2312 charset encoding is used for text, the &quot;~&quot; character will destroy another character near the chunk delimiter. This can lead to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack in pages encoded in HZ-GB-2312. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could exploit these to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4207](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4207))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that the location property can be accessed by binary plugins through top.location with a frame whose name attribute&#39;s value is set to &quot;top&quot;. This can allow for possible cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks through plugins. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4209](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4209))

Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free and buffer overflow issues in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, an attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-4218](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4214">CVE-2012-4214</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4215">CVE-2012-4215</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4216">CVE-2012-4216</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5829">CVE-2012-5829</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5839">CVE-2012-5839</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5840">CVE-2012-5840</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4212">CVE-2012-4212</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4213">CVE-2012-4213</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4217">CVE-2012-4217</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4218))

Several memory corruption flaws were discovered in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, an attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-5838](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5830">CVE-2012-5830</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5833">CVE-2012-5833</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5835">CVE-2012-5835</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5838))
