### Software description

* oxide-qt 

### Details

A buffer overflow was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacked could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process.

Multiple use-after-frees were discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacked could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2014-7907](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-7907))

An integer overflow was discovered in media. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacked could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2014-7908](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-7908))

An uninitialized memory read was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash. ([CVE-2014-7909](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-7909))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2014-7910](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-7910))
