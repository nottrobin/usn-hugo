### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.10

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

 Clement Lecigne discovered a bug in the HFS filesystem. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a kernel oops. ([CVE-2011-2203](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2203))

A bug was discovered in the XFS filesystem&#39;s handling of pathnames. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service, or gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-4077](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4077))

A flaw was found in how the Linux kernel handles user-defined key types. An unprivileged local user could exploit this to crash the system. ([CVE-2011-4110](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4110))

A flaw was found in the Journaling Block Device (JBD). A local attacker able to mount ext3 or ext4 file systems could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-4132](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4132))

Clement Lecigne discovered a bug in the HFS file system bounds checking. When a malformed HFS file system is mounted a local user could crash the system or gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-4330](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4330))

Chen Haogang discovered an integer overflow that could result in memory corruption. A local unprivileged user could use this to crash the system. ([CVE-2012-0044](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0044)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 11.10
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-1206-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [3.0.0-1206.15](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/3.0.0-1206.15) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.
