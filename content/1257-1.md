title: "USN-1257-1: radvd vulnerabilities"
series: [ ubuntu-10.04-lts ]
date: 2011-11-10 12:00:00
description: |
    Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that radvd incorrectly parsed the ND_OPT_DNSSL_INFORMATION option. A remote attacker could exploit this with a specially-crafted request and cause the radvd daemon to crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code. The default compiler options for affected releases should reduce the vulnerability to a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04 and 11.10. ([CVE-2011-3601](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3601))

### radvd vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.10
* Ubuntu 11.04
* Ubuntu 10.10
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

radvd could be made to crash or overwrite certain files if it received specially crafted network traffic.

### Software description

* radvd 

### Details

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that radvd incorrectly parsed the ND_OPT_DNSSL_INFORMATION option. A remote attacker could exploit this with a specially-crafted request and cause the radvd daemon to crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code. The default compiler options for affected releases should reduce the vulnerability to a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 11.04 and 11.10. ([CVE-2011-3601](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3601))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that radvd incorrectly filtered interface names when creating certain files. A local attacker could exploit this to overwrite certain files on the system, bypassing intended permissions. ([CVE-2011-3602](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3602))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that radvd incorrectly handled certain lengths. A remote attacker could exploit this to cause the radvd daemon to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-3604](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3604))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that radvd incorrectly handled delays when used in unicast mode, which is not the default in Ubuntu. If used in unicast mode, a remote attacker could cause radvd outages, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-3605](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3605))
