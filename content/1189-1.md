     It was discovered that the /proc filesystem did not correctly handle permission changes when programs executed. A local attacker could hold open files to examine details about programs running with higher privileges, potentially increasing the chances of exploiting additional vulnerabilities.

### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Summary

Multiple kernel flaws were fixed. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

 It was discovered that the /proc filesystem did not correctly handle permission changes when programs executed. A local attacker could hold open files to examine details about programs running with higher privileges, potentially increasing the chances of exploiting additional vulnerabilities. ([CVE-2011-1020](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1020))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Bluetooth stack did not correctly clear memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2011-1078](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1078))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Bluetooth stack did not correctly check that device name strings were NULL terminated. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service, or leak contents of kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2011-1079](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1079))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that bridge network filtering did not check that name fields were NULL terminated. A local attacker could exploit this to leak contents of kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2011-1080](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1080))

Johan Hovold discovered that the DCCP network stack did not correctly handle certain packet combinations. A remote attacker could send specially crafted network traffic that would crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1093](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1093))

Peter Huewe discovered that the TPM device did not correctly initialize memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel heap memory contents, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2011-1160](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1160))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the IRDA subsystem did not correctly check certain field sizes. If a system was using IRDA, a remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic to crash the system or gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-1180](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1180))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the X.25 Rose network stack did not correctly handle certain fields. If a system was running with Rose enabled, a remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic to gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-1493](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1493))

It was discovered that Bluetooth l2cap and rfcomm did not correctly initialize structures. A local attacker could exploit this to read portions of the kernel stack, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2011-2492](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2492))

Dan Rosenberg discovered flaws in the linux Rose (X.25 PLP) layer used by amateur radio. A local user or a remote user on an X.25 network could exploit these flaws to execute arbitrary code as root. ([CVE-2011-4913](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4913))

Ben Hutchings discovered several flaws in the Linux Rose (X.25 PLP) layer. A local user or a remote user on an X.25 network could exploit these flaws to execute arbitrary code as root. ([CVE-2011-4914](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4914))
