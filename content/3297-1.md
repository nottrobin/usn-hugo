    Bingchang Liu discovered that jbig2dec incorrectly handled memory when decoding malformed image files. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a specially crafted JBIG2 image file, a remote attacker could cause jbig2dec to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.10. ([CVE-2016-9601](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-9601))
