### kdegraphics, koffice, xpdf, cupsys, poppler, tetex-bin vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04
* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Derek Noonburg discovered several integer overflows in the XPDF code, which is present in xpdf, the Poppler library, and tetex-bin. By tricking an user into opening a specially crafted PDF file, an attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application that processes the document.

The CUPS printing system also uses XPDF code to convert PDF files to PostScript. By attempting to print such a crafted PDF file, a remote attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the printer server (user &#39;cupsys&#39;).

Ubuntu 5.10
