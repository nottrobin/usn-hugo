    An SQL injection vulnerability has been discovered when using less popular multibyte encodings (such as SJIS, or BIG5) which contain valid multibyte characters that end with the byte 0x5c (the representation of the backslash character &gt;&gt;\&lt;&lt; in ASCII).

### mysql-dfsg-4.1, mysql-dfsg-5.0 vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
* Ubuntu 5.10

### Details

An SQL injection vulnerability has been discovered when using less popular multibyte encodings (such as SJIS, or BIG5) which contain valid multibyte characters that end with the byte 0x5c (the representation of the backslash character &gt;&gt;\&lt;&lt; in ASCII). 

Many client libraries and applications use the non-standard, but popular way of escaping the &gt;&gt;&#39;&lt;&lt; character by replacing all occurences of it with &gt;&gt;\&#39;&lt;&lt;. If a client application uses one of the affected encodings and does not interpret multibyte characters, and an attacker supplies a specially crafted byte sequence as an input string parameter, this escaping method would then produce a validly-encoded character and an excess &gt;&gt;&#39;&lt;&lt; character which would end the string. All subsequent characters would then be interpreted as SQL code, so the attacker could execute arbitrary SQL commands.

The updated packages fix the mysql_real_escape_string() function to escape quote characters in a safe way. If you use third-party software which uses an ad-hoc method of string escaping, you should convert them to use mysql_real_escape_string() instead, or at least use the standard SQL method of escaping &gt;&gt;&#39;&lt;&lt; with &gt;&gt;&#39;&#39;&lt;&lt;.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : libmysqlclient15off <span>5.0.22-0ubuntu6.06</span>
 : mysql-server-5.0 <span>5.0.22-0ubuntu6.06</span>

Ubuntu 5.10
 : mysql-server-4.1 <span>4.1.12-1ubuntu3.5</span>
 : libmysqlclient14 <span>4.1.12-1ubuntu3.5</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the necessary changes.
