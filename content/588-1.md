### Details

Masaaki Hirose discovered that MySQL could be made to dereference a NULL pointer. An authenticated user could cause a denial of service (application crash) via an EXPLAIN SELECT FROM on the INFORMATION_SCHEMA table. This issue only affects Ubuntu 6.06 and 6.10. ([CVE-2006-7232](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-7232))

Alexander Nozdrin discovered that MySQL did not restore database access privileges when returning from SQL SECURITY INVOKER stored routines. An authenticated user could exploit this to gain privileges. This issue does not affect Ubuntu 7.10. ([CVE-2007-2692](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2692))

Martin Friebe discovered that MySQL did not properly update the DEFINER value of an altered view. An authenticated user could use CREATE SQL SECURITY DEFINER VIEW and ALTER VIEW statements to gain privileges. ([CVE-2007-6303](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-6303))

Luigi Auriemma discovered that yaSSL as included in MySQL did not properly validate its input. A remote attacker could send crafted requests and cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue did not affect Ubuntu 6.06 in the default installation. ([CVE-2008-0227](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0226">CVE-2008-0226</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0227))
