### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

 Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle faults associated with the Stack Segment (SS) register in the x86 architecture. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2014-9322](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-9322))

An information leak in the Linux kernel was discovered that could leak the high 16 bits of the kernel stack address on 32-bit Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM) paravirt guests. A user in the guest OS could exploit this leak to obtain information that could potentially be used to aid in attacking the kernel. ([CVE-2014-8134](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8134))

A race condition with MMIO and PIO transactions in the KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem of the Linux kernel was discovered. A guest OS user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (guest OS crash) via a specially crafted application. ([CVE-2014-7842](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-7842))

The KVM (kernel virtual machine) subsystem of the Linux kernel miscalculates the number of memory pages during the handling of a mapping failure. A guest OS user could exploit this to cause a denial of service (host OS page unpinning) or possibly have unspecified other impact by leveraging guest OS privileges. ([CVE-2014-8369](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8369))

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel does not properly handle faults associated with the Stack Segment (SS) register on the x86 architecture. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (panic). ([CVE-2014-9090](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-9090)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.2.0-1458-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [3.2.0-1458.78](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/3.2.0-1458.78) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
