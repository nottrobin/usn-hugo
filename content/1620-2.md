Original advisory details:

 Mariusz Mlynski and others discovered several flaws in Firefox that allowed a remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. ([CVE-2012-4196](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4194">CVE-2012-4194</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4195">CVE-2012-4195</a>) Antoine Delignat-Lavaud discovered a flaw in the way Firefox handled the Location object. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted page, a remote attacker could exploit this to bypass security protections and perform cross-origin reading of the Location object. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4196))
