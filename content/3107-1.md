### linux vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 16.10

### Summary

The system could be made to run programs as an administrator. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the memory manager of the Linux kernel when handling copy-on-write breakage of private read-only memory mappings. A local attacker could use this to gain administrative privileges. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 16.10
 : [linux-image-4.8.0-26-powerpc64-emb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [4.8.0-26.28](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/4.8.0-26.28) </span> 
 : [linux-image-4.8.0-26-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [4.8.0-26.28](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/4.8.0-26.28) </span> 
 : [linux-image-4.8.0-26-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [4.8.0-26.28](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/4.8.0-26.28) </span> 
 : [linux-image-4.8.0-26-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [4.8.0-26.28](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/4.8.0-26.28) </span> 
 : [linux-image-4.8.0-26-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [4.8.0-26.28](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/4.8.0-26.28) </span> 
 : [linux-image-4.8.0-26-powerpc-e500mc](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [4.8.0-26.28](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/4.8.0-26.28) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
