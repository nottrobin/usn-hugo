* Ubuntu 15.04
* Ubuntu 14.10
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Oxide. 

### Software description

* oxide-qt 

### Details

An issue was discovered in the HTML parser in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions. ([CVE-2015-1235](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1235))

An issue was discovered in the Web Audio API implementation in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same-origin restrictions. ([CVE-2015-1236](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1236))

A use-after-free was discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1237](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1237))

An out-of-bounds write was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1238](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1238))

An out-of-bounds read was discovered in the WebGL implementation. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash. ([CVE-2015-1240](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1240))

An issue was discovered with the interaction of page navigation and touch event handling. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct &quot;tap jacking&quot; attacks. ([CVE-2015-1241](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1241))

A type confusion bug was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1242](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1242))

It was discovered that websocket connections were not upgraded whenever a HSTS policy is active. A remote attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct a man in the middle (MITM) attack. ([CVE-2015-1244](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1244))

An out-of-bounds read was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash. ([CVE-2015-1246](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1246))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1249](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1249))

A use-after-free was discovered in the file picker implementation. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1321](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1321))

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-3333](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-3333))
