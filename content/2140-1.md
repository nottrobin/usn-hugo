    An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel when built with the NetFilter Connection Tracking (NF_CONNTRACK) support for IRC protocol (NF_NAT_IRC). A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive kernel information when communicating over a client- to-client IRC connection(/dcc) via a NAT-ed network.

### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 13.10

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel when built with the NetFilter Connection Tracking (NF_CONNTRACK) support for IRC protocol (NF_NAT_IRC). A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive kernel information when communicating over a client- to-client IRC connection(/dcc) via a NAT-ed network. ([CVE-2014-1690](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1690))

Matthew Thode reported a denial of service vulnerability in the Linux kernel when SELinux support is enabled. A local user with the CAP_MAC_ADMIN capability (and the SELinux mac_admin permission if running in enforcing mode) could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel crash). ([CVE-2014-1874](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1874))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s NFS filesystem. A local users with write access to an NFS share could exploit this flaw to obtain potential sensative information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-2038](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-2038)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 13.10
 : [linux-image-3.11.0-18-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.11.0-18.32](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.11.0-18.32) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.11.0-18-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.11.0-18.32](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.11.0-18.32) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
