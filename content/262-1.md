### Ubuntu 5.10 installer vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.10

### Details

Karl �e discovered that the Ubuntu 5.10 installer failed to clean passwords in the installer log files. Since these files were world-readable, any local user could see the password of the first user account, which has full sudo privileges by default.

The updated packages remove the passwords and additionally make the log files readable only by root.

This does not affect the Ubuntu 4.10, 5.04, or the upcoming 6.04 installer. However, if you upgraded from Ubuntu 5.10 to the current development version of Ubuntu 6.04 (&#39;Dapper Drake&#39;), please ensure that you upgrade the passwd package to version 1:4.0.13-7ubuntu2 to fix the installer log files.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 5.10
 : passwd 
 : base-config 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

None
