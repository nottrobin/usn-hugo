### perl vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.10
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 11.10
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Summary

Perl programs could be made to crash or run programs if they receive specially crafted network traffic or other input.

### Software description

* perl 

### Details

It was discovered that the decode_xs function in the Encode module is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow via a crafted Unicode string. An attacker could use this overflow to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2939](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2939))

It was discovered that the &#39;new&#39; constructor in the Digest module is vulnerable to an eval injection. An attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2011-3597](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3597))

It was discovered that Perl&#39;s &#39;x&#39; string repeat operator is vulnerable to a heap-based buffer overflow. An attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2012-5195](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5195))

Ryo Anazawa discovered that the CGI.pm module does not properly escape newlines in Set-Cookie or P3P (Platform for Privacy Preferences Project) headers. An attacker could use this to inject arbitrary headers into responses from applications that use CGI.pm. ([CVE-2012-5526](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-5526))
