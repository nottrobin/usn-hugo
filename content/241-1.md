    The &quot;mod_imap&quot; module (which provides support for image maps) did not properly escape the &quot;referer&quot; URL which rendered it vulnerable against a cross-site scripting attack. A malicious web page (or HTML email) could trick a user into visiting a site running the vulnerable mod_imap, and employ cross-site-scripting techniques to gather sensitive user information from that site. ([CVE-2005-3352](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2005-3352))

### apache2, apache vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04
* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

The &quot;mod_imap&quot; module (which provides support for image maps) did not properly escape the &quot;referer&quot; URL which rendered it vulnerable against a cross-site scripting attack. A malicious web page (or HTML email) could trick a user into visiting a site running the vulnerable mod_imap, and employ cross-site-scripting techniques to gather sensitive user information from that site. ([CVE-2005-3352](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2005-3352))

Hartmut Keil discovered a Denial of Service vulnerability in the SSL module (&quot;mod_ssl&quot;) that affects SSL-enabled virtual hosts with a customized error page for error 400. By sending a specially crafted request to the server, a remote attacker could crash the server. This only affects Apache 2, and only if the &quot;worker&quot; implementation (apache2-mpm-worker) is used. ([CVE-2005-3357](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2005-3357))
