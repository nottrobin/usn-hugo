### linux-ec2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Multiple kernel flaws have been fixed. 

### Software description

* linux-ec2 

### Details

 Dan Rosenberg discovered that multiple terminal ioctls did not correctly initialize structure memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read portions of kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2010-4077](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4076">CVE-2010-4076</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4077))

Alex Shi and Eric Dumazet discovered that the network stack did not correctly handle packet backlogs. A remote attacker could exploit this by sending a large amount of network traffic to cause the system to run out of memory, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2010-4805](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4251">CVE-2010-4251</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4805))

It was discovered that the /proc filesystem did not correctly handle permission changes when programs executed. A local attacker could hold open files to examine details about programs running with higher privileges, potentially increasing the chances of exploiting additional vulnerabilities. ([CVE-2011-1020](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1020))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the X.25 Rose network stack did not correctly handle certain fields. If a system was running with Rose enabled, a remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic to gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-1493](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1493))

Timo Warns discovered that the GUID partition parsing routines did not correctly validate certain structures. A local attacker with physical access could plug in a specially crafted block device to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1577](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1577))

It was discovered that CIFS incorrectly handled authentication. When a user had a CIFS share mounted that required authentication, a local user could mount the same share without knowing the correct password. ([CVE-2011-1585](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1585))

It was discovered that the GRE protocol incorrectly handled netns initialization. A remote attacker could send a packet while the ip_gre module was loading, and crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1767](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1767))

It was discovered that the IP/IP protocol incorrectly handled netns initialization. A remote attacker could send a packet while the ipip module was loading, and crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1768](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1768))

Ben Hutchings reported a flaw in the kernel&#39;s handling of corrupt LDM partitions. A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service or escalate privileges. ([CVE-2011-2182](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2182))

Andrea Righi discovered a race condition in the KSM memory merging support. If KSM was being used, a local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2183](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2183))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the IPv4 diagnostic routines did not correctly validate certain requests. A local attacker could exploit this to consume CPU resources, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2213](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2213))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that taskstats listeners were not correctly handled. A local attacker could expoit this to exhaust memory and CPU resources, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2484](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2484))

It was discovered that Bluetooth l2cap and rfcomm did not correctly initialize structures. A local attacker could exploit this to read portions of the kernel stack, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2011-2492](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2492))

Mauro Carvalho Chehab discovered that the si4713 radio driver did not correctly check the length of memory copies. If this hardware was available, a local attacker could exploit this to crash the system or gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-2700](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2700))

Herbert Xu discovered that certain fields were incorrectly handled when Generic Receive Offload ([CVE-2011-2723](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2723))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Comedi driver did not correctly clear memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2011-2909](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2909))

The performance counter subsystem did not correctly handle certain counters. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2918](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2918))

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel&#39;s /proc/*/*map* interface. A local, unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-3637](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3637))

Ben Hutchings discovered several flaws in the Linux Rose (X.25 PLP) layer. A local user or a remote user on an X.25 network could exploit these flaws to execute arbitrary code as root. ([CVE-2011-4914](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4914)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-2.6.32-318-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2) <span> [2.6.32-318.38](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2/2.6.32-318.38) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
