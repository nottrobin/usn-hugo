### curl vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 16.10
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in curl. 

### Software description

* curl 

### Details

It was discovered that curl incorrectly reused client certificates when built with NSS. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to hijack the authentication of a TLS connection. ([CVE-2016-7141](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-7141))

Nguyen Vu Hoang discovered that curl incorrectly handled escaping certain strings. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-7167](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-7167))

It was discovered that curl incorrectly handled storing cookies. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to inject cookies for arbitrary domains in the cookie jar. ([CVE-2016-8615](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-8615))

It was discovered that curl incorrect handled case when comparing user names and passwords. A remote attacker with knowledge of a case-insensitive version of the correct password could possibly use this issue to cause a connection to be reused. ([CVE-2016-8616](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-8616))

It was discovered that curl incorrect handled memory when encoding to base64. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-8617](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-8617))

It was discovered that curl incorrect handled memory when preparing formatted output. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-8618](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-8618))

It was discovered that curl incorrect handled memory when performing Kerberos authentication. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-8619](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-8619))

Luật Nguyễn discovered that curl incorrectly handled parsing globs. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 14.04 LTS, Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 16.10. ([CVE-2016-8620](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-8620))

Luật Nguyễn discovered that curl incorrectly handled converting dates. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-8621](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-8621))

It was discovered that curl incorrectly handled URL percent-encoding decoding. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause curl to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-8622](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-8622))

It was discovered that curl incorrectly handled shared cookies. A remote server could possibly obtain incorrect cookies or other sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-8623](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-8623))

Fernando Muñoz discovered that curl incorrect parsed certain URLs. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to trick curl into connecting to a different host. ([CVE-2016-8624](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-8624))
