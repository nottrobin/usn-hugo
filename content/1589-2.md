### glibc regression

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Summary

USN-1589-1 exposed a regression in the GNU C Library floating point parser. 

### Software description

* glibc 

### Details

USN-1589-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the GNU C Library. One of the updates exposed a regression in the floating point parser. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that positional arguments to the printf() family of functions were not handled properly in the GNU C Library. An attacker could possibly use this to cause a stack-based buffer overflow, creating a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2012-3480](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3404">CVE-2012-3404</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3405">CVE-2012-3405</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3406">CVE-2012-3406</a>) It was discovered that multiple integer overflows existed in the strtod(), strtof() and strtold() functions in the GNU C Library. An attacker could possibly use this to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow, creating a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.
