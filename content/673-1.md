    Drew Yao discovered that libxml2 did not correctly handle certain corrupt XML documents.  If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a malicious XML document, a remote attacker could cause applications linked against libxml2 to enter an infinite loop, leading to a denial of service.

([CVE-2008-4225](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4225))

Drew Yao discovered that libxml2 did not correctly handle large memory allocations. If a user or automated system were tricked into processing a very large XML document, a remote attacker could cause applications linked against libxml2 to crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-4226](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4226))
