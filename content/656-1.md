### cupsys vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 7.10
* Ubuntu 7.04
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* cupsys 

### Details

It was discovered that the SGI image filter in CUPS did not perform proper bounds checking. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted SGI image, an attacker could cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-3639](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3639))

It was discovered that the texttops filter in CUPS did not properly validate page metrics. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted text file, an attacker could cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-3640](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3640))

It was discovered that the HP-GL filter in CUPS did not properly check for invalid pen parameters. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted HP-GL or HP-GL/2 file, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code with user privileges. In Ubuntu 7.10 and 8.04 LTS, attackers would be isolated by the AppArmor CUPS profile. ([CVE-2008-3641](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3641))

NOTE: The previous update for CUPS on Ubuntu 6.06 LTS did not have the the fix for [CVE-2008-1722](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-1722) applied. This update includes fixes for the problem. We apologize for the inconvenience.
