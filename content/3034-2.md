### linux-lts-trusty vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

The system could be made to crash under certain conditions. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-trusty 

### Details

USN-3034-1 fixed a vulnerability in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

Jan Stancek discovered that the Linux kernel&#39;s memory manager did not properly handle moving pages mapped by the asynchronous I/O (AIO) ring buffer to the other nodes. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-92-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty) <span> [3.13.0-92.139~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-92.139~precise1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-92-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty) <span> [3.13.0-92.139~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-92.139~precise1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
