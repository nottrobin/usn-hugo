### tiff vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.04
* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Tavis Ormandy discovered a buffer overflow in the TIFF library. A malicious image with an invalid &quot;bits per sample&quot; number could be constructed which, when decoded, would have resulted in execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the process using the library.
