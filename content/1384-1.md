description: |
     A bug was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s calculation of OOM (Out of memory) scores, that would result in the wrong process being killed. A user could use this to kill the process with the highest OOM score, even if that process belongs to another user or the system.

### linux-lts-backport-oneiric vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-backport-oneiric 

### Details

 A bug was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s calculation of OOM (Out of memory) scores, that would result in the wrong process being killed. A user could use this to kill the process with the highest OOM score, even if that process belongs to another user or the system. ([CVE-2011-4097](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4097))

Paolo Bonzini discovered a flaw in Linux&#39;s handling of the SG_IO ioctl command. A local user, or user in a VM could exploit this flaw to bypass restrictions and gain read/write access to all data on the affected block device. ([CVE-2011-4127](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4127))

A flaw was found in KVM&#39;s Programmable Interval Timer (PIT). When a virtual interrupt control is not available a local user could use this to cause a denial of service by starting a timer. ([CVE-2011-4622](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4622))

A flaw was discovered in the XFS filesystem. If a local user mounts a specially crafted XFS image it could potential execute arbitrary code on the system. ([CVE-2012-0038](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0038))

Andy Whitcroft discovered a that the Overlayfs filesystem was not doing the extended permission checks needed by cgroups and Linux Security Modules (LSMs). A local user could exploit this to by-pass security policy and access files that should not be accessible. ([CVE-2012-0055](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0055))

A flaw was found in the linux kernels IPv4 IGMP query processing. A remote attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-0207](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0207))

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel&#39;s ext4 file system when mounting a corrupt filesystem. A user-assisted remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-2100](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2100)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-16-virtual](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric) <span> [3.0.0-16.29~lucid1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric/3.0.0-16.29~lucid1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-16-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric) <span> [3.0.0-16.29~lucid1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric/3.0.0-16.29~lucid1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-16-server](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric) <span> [3.0.0-16.29~lucid1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric/3.0.0-16.29~lucid1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-16-generic-pae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric) <span> [3.0.0-16.29~lucid1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-backport-oneiric/3.0.0-16.29~lucid1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
