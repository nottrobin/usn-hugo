    The execution of custom PostgreSQL functions can be restricted with the EXECUTE privilege. However, previous versions did not check this privilege when executing a function which was part of an aggregate. As a result, any database user could circumvent the EXECUTE restriction of functions with a particular (but very common) parameter structure by creating an aggregate wrapper around the function.

### postgresql vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

The execution of custom PostgreSQL functions can be restricted with the EXECUTE privilege. However, previous versions did not check this privilege when executing a function which was part of an aggregate. As a result, any database user could circumvent the EXECUTE restriction of functions with a particular (but very common) parameter structure by creating an aggregate wrapper around the function. (CAN-2005-0244)

Several buffer overflows have been discovered in the SQL parser. These could be exploited by any database user to crash the PostgreSQL server or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the server. (CAN-2005-0245, CAN-2005-0247)

Finally, this update fixes a Denial of Service vulnerability of the contributed &quot;intagg&quot; module. By constructing specially crafted arrays, a database user was able to corrupt and crash the PostgreSQL server. (CAN-2005-0246). Please note that this module is part of the &quot;postgresql-contrib&quot; package, which is not officially supported by Ubuntu.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 4.10
 : postgresql-contrib 
 : postgresql 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

None
