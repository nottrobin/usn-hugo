### wget vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 9.10
* Ubuntu 9.04
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* wget 

### Details

It was discovered that Wget would use filenames provided by the server when following 3xx redirects. If a user or automated system were tricked into downloading a file from a malicious site, a remote attacker could create the file with an arbitrary name (e.g. .wgetrc), and possibly run arbitrary code. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [wget](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wget) <span> [1.12-1.1ubuntu2.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wget/1.12-1.1ubuntu2.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 9.10
 : [wget](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wget) <span> [1.11.4-2ubuntu2.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wget/1.11.4-2ubuntu2.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 9.04
 : [wget](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wget) <span> [1.11.4-2ubuntu1.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wget/1.11.4-2ubuntu1.2) </span> 

Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
 : [wget](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wget) <span> [1.10.2-3ubuntu1.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wget/1.10.2-3ubuntu1.2) </span> 

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : [wget](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wget) <span> [1.10.2-1ubuntu1.2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/wget/1.10.2-1ubuntu1.2) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: This update changes previous behaviour by ignoring the filename supplied by the server during redirects. To re-enable previous behaviour, use the new --trust-server-names option.
