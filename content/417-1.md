    Jeff Trout discovered that the PostgreSQL server did not sufficiently check data types of SQL function arguments in some cases. An authenticated attacker could exploit this to crash the database server or read out arbitrary locations in the server&#39;s memory, which could allow retrieving database content the attacker should not be able to see.

### postgresql-7.4/-8.0/-8.1 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
* Ubuntu 5.10

### Details

Jeff Trout discovered that the PostgreSQL server did not sufficiently check data types of SQL function arguments in some cases. An authenticated attacker could exploit this to crash the database server or read out arbitrary locations in the server&#39;s memory, which could allow retrieving database content the attacker should not be able to see. ([CVE-2007-0555](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0555))

Jeff Trout reported that the query planner did not verify that a table was still compatible with a previously made query plan. By using ALTER COLUMN TYPE during query execution, an attacker could exploit this to read out arbitrary locations in the server&#39;s memory, which could allow retrieving database content the attacker should not be able to see. ([CVE-2007-0556](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0556))
