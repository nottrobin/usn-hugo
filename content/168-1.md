### gaim vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.04
* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Daniel Atallah discovered a Denial of Service vulnerability in the file transfer handler of OSCAR (the module that handles various instant messaging protocols like ICQ). A remote attacker could crash the Gaim client of an user by attempting to send him a file with a name that contains invalid UTF-8 characters. (CAN-2005-2102)

It was found that specially crafted &quot;away&quot; messages triggered a buffer overflow. A remote attacker could exploit this to crash the Gaim client or possibly even execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the Gaim user. (CAN-2005-2103)

Szymon Zygmunt and Micha≈Ç Bartoszkiewicz discovered a memory alignment error in the Gadu library, which was fixed in USN-162-1. However, it was discovered that Gaim contains a copy of the vulnerable code. By sending specially crafted messages over the Gadu protocol, a remote attacker could crash Gaim. (CAN-2005-2370)
