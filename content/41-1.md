    Greg MacManus discovered an integer overflow in Samba&#39;s smbd daemon. Requesting a very large number of access control descriptors from the server caused an integer overflow, which resulted in a memory allocation being too short, thus causing a buffer overflow. By sending carefully crafted data, an attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code on the server with full root permissions.
