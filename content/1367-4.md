### xulrunner-1.9.2 vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.10
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Xulrunner based applications could be made to crash or run programs as your login if they opened a specially crafted file.

### Software description

* xulrunner-1.9.2 

### Details

USN-1367-1 fixed vulnerabilities in libpng. This provides the corresponding update for Xulrunner.

Original advisory details: Jueri Aedla discovered that libpng did not properly verify the size used when allocating memory during chunk decompression. If a user or automated system using libpng were tricked into opening a specially crafted image, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service or execute code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2011-3026](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3026))
