### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.10

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

Andy Adamson discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s NFSv4 implementation. A remote NFS server (attacker) could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-4131](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4131))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s KVM (kernel virtual machine). An administrative user in the guest OS could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service in the host OS. ([CVE-2012-2121](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2121))

Schacher Raindel discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s memory handling when hugetlb is enabled. An unprivileged local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service and potentially gain higher privileges. ([CVE-2012-2133](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2133))

Stephan Mueller reported a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s dl2k network driver&#39;s handling of ioctls. An unprivileged local user could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-2313](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2313))

Timo Warns reported multiple flaws in the Linux kernel&#39;s hfsplus filesystem. An unprivileged local user could exploit these flaws to gain root system priviliges. ([CVE-2012-2319](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2319))

Xi Wang discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s i915 graphics driver handling of cliprect on 32 bit systems. An unprivileged local attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service or potentially gain root privileges. ([CVE-2012-2383](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2383))

Xi Wang discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s i915 graphics driver handling of buffer_count on 32 bit systems. An unprivileged local attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service or potentially gain root privileges. ([CVE-2012-2384](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2384)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 11.10
 : [linux-image-3.0.0-1211-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [3.0.0-1211.23](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/3.0.0-1211.23) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
