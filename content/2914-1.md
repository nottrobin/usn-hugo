    Yuval Yarom, Daniel Genkin, and Nadia Heninger discovered that OpenSSL was vulnerable to a side-channel attack on modular exponentiation. On certain CPUs, a local attacker could possibly use this issue to recover RSA keys. This flaw is known as CacheBleed. ([CVE-2016-0702](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-0702))

### openssl vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 15.10
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in OpenSSL. 

### Software description

* openssl 

### Details

Yuval Yarom, Daniel Genkin, and Nadia Heninger discovered that OpenSSL was vulnerable to a side-channel attack on modular exponentiation. On certain CPUs, a local attacker could possibly use this issue to recover RSA keys. This flaw is known as CacheBleed. ([CVE-2016-0702](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-0702))

Adam Langley discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when parsing DSA private keys. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-0705](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-0705))

Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled hex digit calculation in the BN_hex2bn function. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-0797](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-0797))

Emilia KÃ¤sper discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when performing SRP user database lookups. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause OpenSSL to consume memory, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-0798](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-0798))

Guido Vranken discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled memory when printing very long strings. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-0799](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-0799)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 15.10
 : [libssl1.0.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl) <span> [1.0.2d-0ubuntu1.4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/1.0.2d-0ubuntu1.4) </span> 

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 : [libssl1.0.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl) <span> [1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.18](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/1.0.1f-1ubuntu2.18) </span> 

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [libssl1.0.0](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl) <span> [1.0.1-4ubuntu5.35](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssl/1.0.1-4ubuntu5.35) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.
