    It was discovered that cron did not properly check the return code of the setgid() and initgroups() system calls. A local attacker could use this to escalate group privileges. Please note that cron versions 3.0pl1-64 and later were already patched to address the more serious setuid() check referred to by [CVE-2006-2607](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-2607).
