### linux-source-2.6.15 vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Details

A flaw was discovered in dvb ULE decapsulation. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted message and cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2006-4623](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-4623))

The compat_sys_mount function allowed local users to cause a denial of service when mounting a smbfs filesystem in compatibility mode. ([CVE-2006-7203](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-7203))

The Omnikey CardMan 4040 driver (cm4040_cs) did not limit the size of buffers passed to read() and write(). A local attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with kernel privileges. ([CVE-2007-0005](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0005))

Due to an variable handling flaw in the ipv6_getsockopt_sticky() function a local attacker could exploit the getsockopt() calls to read arbitrary kernel memory. This could disclose sensitive data. ([CVE-2007-1000](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-1000))

Ilja van Sprundel discovered that Bluetooth setsockopt calls could leak kernel memory contents via an uninitialized stack buffer. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to view sensitive kernel information. ([CVE-2007-1353](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-1353))

A flaw was discovered in the handling of netlink messages. Local attackers could cause infinite recursion leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-1861](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-1861))

The random number generator was hashing a subset of the available entropy, leading to slightly less random numbers. Additionally, systems without an entropy source would be seeded with the same inputs at boot time, leading to a repeatable series of random numbers. ([CVE-2007-2453](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2453))

A flaw was discovered in the PPP over Ethernet implementation. Local attackers could manipulate ioctls and cause kernel memory consumption leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-2525](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2525))

An integer underflow was discovered in the cpuset filesystem. If mounted, local attackers could obtain kernel memory using large file offsets while reading the tasks file. This could disclose sensitive data. ([CVE-2007-2875](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2875))

Vilmos Nebehaj discovered that the SCTP netfilter code did not correctly validate certain states. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted packet causing a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-2876](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2876))

Luca Tettamanti discovered a flaw in the VFAT compat ioctls on 64-bit systems. A local attacker could corrupt a kernel_dirent struct and cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-2878](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2878))

A flaw was discovered in the cluster manager. A remote attacker could connect to the DLM port and block further DLM operations. ([CVE-2007-3380](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-3380))

A flaw was discovered in the usblcd driver. A local attacker could cause large amounts of kernel memory consumption, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-3513](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-3513))
