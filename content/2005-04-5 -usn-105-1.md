description: |
    Two Denial of Service vulnerabilities have been discovered in the getimagesize() function. getimagesize() uses format specific internal functions php_handle_iff() and php_handle_jpeg() which get stuck in infinite loops when certain (invalid) size parameters are read from the image. In web applications that allow users to upload arbitrary image files, a remote attacker could render the server unavailable by uploading specially crafted images.
