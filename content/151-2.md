### dpkg, ia32-libs, amd64-libs vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.04
* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

USN-148-1 and USN-151-1 fixed two security flaws in zlib, which could be exploited to cause Denial of Service attacks or even arbitrary code execution with malicious data streams.

Most applications use the shared library provided by the &quot;zlib1g&quot; package; however, some packages contain copies of the affected zlib code, so they need to be upgraded as well.
