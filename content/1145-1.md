description: |
    It was discovered that QEMU did not properly perform validation of I/O operations from the guest which could lead to heap corruption. An attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service of the guest or possibly execute code with the privileges of the user invoking the program.

### qemu-kvm vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.04
* Ubuntu 10.10
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

A privileged attacker within a QEMU guest could cause QEMU to crash. 

### Software description

* qemu-kvm 

### Details

It was discovered that QEMU did not properly perform validation of I/O operations from the guest which could lead to heap corruption. An attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service of the guest or possibly execute code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2011-1750](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1750))

Nelson Elhage discoverd that QEMU did not properly handle memory when removing ISA devices. An attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service of the guest or possibly execute code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2011-1751](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1751))

When using QEMU with libvirt or virtualization management software based on libvirt such as Eucalyptus and OpenStack, QEMU guests are individually isolated by an AppArmor profile by default in Ubuntu. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 11.04
 : [qemu-kvm](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/qemu-kvm) <span> [0.14.0+noroms-0ubuntu4.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/qemu-kvm/0.14.0+noroms-0ubuntu4.1) </span>
