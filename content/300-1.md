### wv2 vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04

### Details

libwv2 did not sufficiently check the validity of its input. Certain invalid Word documents caused a buffer overflow. By tricking a user into opening a specially crafted Word file with an application that uses libwv2, this could be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges.

The only packaged application using this library is KWord.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : libwv2-dev <span>0.2.2-5ubuntu0.1</span>

 : libwv2-1 <span>0.2.2-1ubuntu1.1</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system upgrade you need to restart KWord to effect the necessary changes.
