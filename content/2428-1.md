    Gary Kwong, Randell Jesup, Nils Ohlmeier, Jesse Ruderman, and Max Jonas Werner discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.
