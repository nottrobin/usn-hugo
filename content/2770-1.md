### oxide-qt vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 15.04
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Oxide. 

### Software description

* oxide-qt 

### Details

It was discovered that ContainerNode::parserInsertBefore in Blink would incorrectly proceed with a DOM tree insertion in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2015-6755](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-6755))

A use-after-free was discovered in the service worker implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-6757](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-6757))

It was discovered that Blink did not ensure that the origin of LocalStorage resources are considered unique. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2015-6759](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-6759))

A race condition and memory corruption was discovered in FFmpeg. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-6761](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-6761))

It was discovered that CSSFontFaceSrcValue::fetch in Blink did not use CORS in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to bypass same origin restrictions. ([CVE-2015-6762](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-6762))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-6763](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-6763))

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-7834](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7834))
