    Alin Rad Pop of Secunia Research discovered that Evolution did not properly validate timezone data when processing iCalendar attachments. If a user disabled the ITip Formatter plugin and viewed a crafted iCalendar attachment, an attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute code with user privileges. Note that the ITip Formatter plugin is enabled by default in Ubuntu. ([CVE-2008-1108](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-1108))
