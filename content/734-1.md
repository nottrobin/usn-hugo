    It was discovered that FFmpeg did not correctly handle certain malformed Ogg Media (OGM) files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted Ogg Media file, an attacker could cause the application using FFmpeg to crash, leading to a denial of service.

### Details

It was discovered that FFmpeg did not correctly handle certain malformed Ogg Media (OGM) files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted Ogg Media file, an attacker could cause the application using FFmpeg to crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-4610](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4610))

It was discovered that FFmpeg did not correctly handle certain parameters when creating DTS streams. If a user were tricked into processing certain commands, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.10. ([CVE-2008-4866](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4866))

It was discovered that FFmpeg did not correctly handle certain malformed DTS Coherent Acoustics (DCA) files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted DCA file, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-4867](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-4867))

It was discovered that FFmpeg did not correctly handle certain malformed 4X movie (4xm) files. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted 4xm file, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-0385](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-0385))
