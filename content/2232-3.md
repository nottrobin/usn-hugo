* Ubuntu 13.10
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

USN-2232-1 introduced a regression in OpenSSL. 

### Software description

* openssl 

### Details

USN-2232-1 fixed vulnerabilities in OpenSSL. The upstream fix for [CVE-2014-0224](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-0224) caused a regression for certain applications that use renegotiation, such as PostgreSQL. This update fixes the problem.

Original advisory details:

 Jüri Aedla discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled invalid DTLS fragments. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 13.10, and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-3470](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-0195">CVE-2014-0195</a>) Imre Rad discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled DTLS recursions. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-0221">CVE-2014-0221</a>) KIKUCHI Masashi discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain handshakes. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and possibly decrypt and modify traffic. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-0224">CVE-2014-0224</a>) Felix Gröbert and Ivan Fratrić discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled anonymous ECDH ciphersuites. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, Ubuntu 13.10, and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.
