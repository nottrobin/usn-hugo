    It was discovered that positional arguments to the printf() family of functions were not handled properly in the GNU C Library. An attacker could possibly use this to cause a stack-based buffer overflow, creating a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code.

### eglibc, glibc vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 11.10
* Ubuntu 11.04
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Summary

Multiple security issues were fixed in the GNU C Library. 

### Software description

* eglibc 

* glibc 

### Details

It was discovered that positional arguments to the printf() family of functions were not handled properly in the GNU C Library. An attacker could possibly use this to cause a stack-based buffer overflow, creating a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2012-3406](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3404">CVE-2012-3404</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3405">CVE-2012-3405</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3406))

It was discovered that multiple integer overflows existed in the strtod(), strtof() and strtold() functions in the GNU C Library. An attacker could possibly use this to trigger a stack-based buffer overflow, creating a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2012-3480](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3480)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:
