A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 9.10

### Software description

* firefox-3.5 

* xulrunner-1.9.1 

### Details

Jesse Ruderman, Josh Soref, Martijn Wargers, Jose Angel, Olli Pettay, and David James discovered several flaws in the browser and JavaScript engines of Firefox. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-3986](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3979">CVE-2009-3979</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3980">CVE-2009-3980</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3982">CVE-2009-3982</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3986))

Takehiro Takahashi discovered flaws in the NTLM implementation in Firefox. If an NTLM authenticated user visited a malicious website, a remote attacker could send requests to other applications, authenticated as the user. ([CVE-2009-3983](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3983))

Jonathan Morgan discovered that Firefox did not properly display SSL indicators under certain circumstances. This could be used by an attacker to spoof an encrypted page, such as in a phishing attack. ([CVE-2009-3984](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3984))

Jordi Chancel discovered that Firefox did not properly display invalid URLs for a blank page. If a user were tricked into accessing a malicious website, an attacker could exploit this to spoof the location bar, such as in a phishing attack. ([CVE-2009-3985](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3985))

David Keeler, Bob Clary, and Dan Kaminsky discovered several flaws in third party media libraries. If a user were tricked into opening a crafted media file, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-3389](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3388">CVE-2009-3388</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3389)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 9.10
 : [xulrunner-1.9.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xulrunner-1.9.1) <span> [1.9.1.6+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.9.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/xulrunner-1.9.1/1.9.1.6+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.9.10.1) </span> 
 : [firefox-3.5](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox-3.5) <span> [3.5.6+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.9.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox-3.5/3.5.6+nobinonly-0ubuntu0.9.10.1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).
