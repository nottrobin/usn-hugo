### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.04

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

Andrea Righi discovered a race condition in the KSM memory merging support. If KSM was being used, a local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2183](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2183))

It was discovered that an mmap() call with the MAP_PRIVATE flag on &quot;/dev/zero&quot; was incorrectly handled. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2479](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2479))

Vasily Averin discovered that the NFS Lock Manager (NLM) incorrectly handled unlock requests. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2491](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2491))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that taskstats did not enforce access restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain information, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2011-2494](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2494))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that /proc/PID/io did not enforce access restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain information, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2011-2495](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2495))

Robert Swiecki discovered that mapping extensions were incorrectly handled. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2496](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2496))

It was discovered that the wireless stack incorrectly verified SSID lengths. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service or gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-2517](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2517))

Christian Ohm discovered that the perf command looks for configuration files in the current directory. If a privileged user were tricked into running perf in a directory containing a malicious configuration file, an attacker could run arbitrary commands and possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2011-2905](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2905))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that the Comedi driver did not correctly clear memory. A local attacker could exploit this to read kernel stack memory, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2011-2909](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2909))

Yogesh Sharma discovered that CIFS did not correctly handle UNCs that had no prefixpaths. A local attacker with access to a CIFS partition could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-3363](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3363)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 11.04
 : [linux-image-2.6.38-1209-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [2.6.38-1209.17](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/2.6.38-1209.17) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
