title: "USN-19-1: squid vulnerabilities"
releases: [ ubuntu-04.10 ]
date: 2004-11-06 12:00:00
description: |
    Recently, two Denial of Service vulnerabilities have been discovered in squid, a WWW proxy cache. Insufficient input validation in the NTLM authentication handler allowed a remote attacker to crash the service by sending a specially crafted NTLMSSP packet. Likewise, due to an insufficient validation of ASN.1 headers, a remote attacker could restart the server (causing all open connections to be dropped) by sending certain SNMP packets with negative length fields.
