    Harald Koenig discovered that sudo did not correctly handle certain privilege changes when handling groups.  If a local attacker belonged to a group included in a &quot;RunAs&quot; list in the /etc/sudoers file, that user could gain root privileges.  This was not an issue for the default sudoers file shipped with Ubuntu.
