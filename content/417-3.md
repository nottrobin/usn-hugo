### postgresql-8.1 regression

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Details

USN-417-2 fixed a severe regression in the PostgreSQL server that was introduced in USN-417-1 and caused some valid queries to be aborted with a type error. This update fixes a similar (but much less prominent) error.
