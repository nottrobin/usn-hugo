### openjdk-8 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 17.04
* Ubuntu 16.10
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in OpenJDK 8. 

### Software description

* openjdk-8 

### Details

It was discovered that OpenJDK improperly re-used cached NTLM connections in some situations. A remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a Java application to perform actions with the credentials of a different user. ([CVE-2017-3509](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-3509))

It was discovered that an untrusted library search path flaw existed in the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) component of OpenJDK. A local attacker could possibly use this to gain the privileges of a Java application. ([CVE-2017-3511](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-3511))

It was discovered that the Java API for XML Processing (JAXP) component in OpenJDK did not properly enforce size limits when parsing XML documents. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (processor and memory consumption). ([CVE-2017-3526](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-3526))

It was discovered that the FTP client implementation in OpenJDK did not properly sanitize user inputs. If a user was tricked into opening a specially crafted FTP URL, a remote attacker could use this to manipulate the FTP connection. ([CVE-2017-3533](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-3533))

It was discovered that OpenJDK allowed MD5 to be used as an algorithm for JAR integrity verification. An attacker could possibly use this to modify the contents of a JAR file without detection. ([CVE-2017-3539](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-3539))

It was discovered that the SMTP client implementation in OpenJDK did not properly sanitize sender and recipient addresses. A remote attacker could use this to specially craft email addresses and gain control of a Java application&#39;s SMTP connections. ([CVE-2017-3544](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-3544))
