series: [ ubuntu-4.10]

description: |
    A firewall bypass vulnerability has been found in shorewall. If MACLIST_TTL was set to a value greater than 0 or MACLIST_DISPOSITION was set to &quot;ACCEPT&quot; in /etc/shorewall/shorewall.conf, and a client was positively identified through its MAC address, that client bypassed all other policies/rules in place. This could allow external computers to get access to ports that are intended to be restricted by the firewall policy.
