    The SSLv2 protocol support in the NSS library did not sufficiently check the validity of public keys presented with a SSL certificate. A malicious SSL web site using SSLv2 could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges.

### mozilla-thunderbird vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
* Ubuntu 5.10

### Details

The SSLv2 protocol support in the NSS library did not sufficiently check the validity of public keys presented with a SSL certificate. A malicious SSL web site using SSLv2 could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the user&#39;s privileges. ([CVE-2007-0008](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0008))

The SSLv2 protocol support in the NSS library did not sufficiently verify the validity of client master keys presented in an SSL client certificate. A remote attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code in a server application that uses the NSS library. ([CVE-2007-0009](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0009))

Various flaws have been reported that could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with user privileges by tricking the user into opening a malicious web page. ([CVE-2007-0777](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0775">CVE-2007-0775</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0776">CVE-2007-0776</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0777))

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 6.10

Ubuntu 6.06 LTS
 : mozilla-thunderbird <span>1.5.0.10-0ubuntu0.6.06</span>

Ubuntu 5.10
