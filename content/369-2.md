### postgresql-8.1 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 6.10

### Details

USN-369-1 fixed three minor PostgreSQL 8.1 vulnerabilities for Ubuntu 6.06 LTS. This update provides the corresponding update for Ubuntu 6.10.

Original advisory details:

 Michael Fuhr discovered an incorrect type check when handling unknown literals. By attempting to coerce such a literal to the ANYARRAY type, a local authenticated attacker could cause a server crash. ([CVE-2006-5542](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-5541">CVE-2006-5541</a>) Josh Drake and Alvaro Herrera reported a crash when using aggregate functions in UPDATE statements. A local authenticated attacker could exploit this to crash the server backend. This update disables this construct, since it is not very well defined and forbidden by the SQL standard. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-5540">CVE-2006-5540</a>) Sergey Koposov discovered a flaw in the duration logging. This could cause a server crash under certain circumstances. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2006-5542)) Please note that these flaws can usually not be exploited through web and other applications that use a database and are exposed to untrusted input, so these flaws do not pose a threat in usual setups.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 6.10
 : postgresql-8.1 <span>8.1.4-7ubuntu0.1</span>

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the necessary changes.
