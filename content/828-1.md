description: Russell Senior discovered that the system authentication module selection
  mechanism for PAM did not safely handle an empty selection. If an administrator
  had specifically removed the default list of modules or failed to chose a module
  when operating debconf in a very unlikely non-default configuration, PAM would allow
  any authentication attempt, which could lead to remote attackers gaining access
  to a system with arbitrary privileges.  This did not affect default Ubuntu installations.

### Details

Russell Senior discovered that the system authentication module selection mechanism for PAM did not safely handle an empty selection. If an administrator had specifically removed the default list of modules or failed to chose a module when operating debconf in a very unlikely non-default configuration, PAM would allow any authentication attempt, which could lead to remote attackers gaining access to a system with arbitrary privileges. This did not affect default Ubuntu installations.
