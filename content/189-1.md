### cpio vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.04
* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Imran Ghory found a race condition in the handling of output files. While a file was unpacked with cpio, a local attacker with write permissions to the target directory could exploit this to change the permissions of arbitrary files of the cpio user. (CAN-2005-1111)

Imran Ghory discovered a path traversal vulnerability. Even when the --no-absolute-filenames option was specified, cpio did not filter out &quot;..&quot; path components. By tricking an user into unpacking a malicious cpio archive, this could be exploited to install files in arbitrary paths with the privileges of the user calling cpio. (CAN-2005-1229)

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 5.04
 : cpio
