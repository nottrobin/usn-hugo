### linux-ec2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ec2 

### Details

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported buffer underflow errors in the implementation of the XFS filesystem in the Linux kernel. A local user with CAP_SYS_ADMIN could exploit these flaw to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly other unspecified issues. ([CVE-2013-6382](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-6382))

Evan Huus reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel&#39;s radiotap header parsing. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (buffer over- read) via a specially crafted header. ([CVE-2013-7027](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-7027))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg systemcalls when used with ISDN sockets in the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7266](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-7266))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg systemcalls when used with apple talk sockets in the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7267](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-7267))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg systemcalls when used with ipx protocol sockets in the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7268](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-7268))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg systemcalls when used with the netrom address family in the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7269](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-7269))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg systemcalls when used with packet address family sockets in the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7270](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-7270))

An information leak was discovered in the recvfrom, recvmmsg, and recvmsg systemcalls when used with x25 protocol sockets in the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this leak to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-7271](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-7271))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s SIOCWANDEV ioctl call. A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1444](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1444))

An information leak was discovered in the wanxl ioctl function the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1445](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1445))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s hamradio YAM driver for AX.25 packet radio. A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2014-1446](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1446))

Matthew Thode reported a denial of service vulnerability in the Linux kernel when SELinux support is enabled. A local user with the CAP_MAC_ADMIN capability (and the SELinux mac_admin permission if running in enforcing mode) could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (kernel crash). ([CVE-2014-1874](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1874)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-2.6.32-362-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2) <span> [2.6.32-362.75](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2/2.6.32-362.75) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
