    A buffer overflow was discovered in libgd2&#39;s font renderer.  By tricking an application using libgd2 into rendering a specially crafted string with a JIS encoded font, a remote attacker could read heap memory or crash the application, leading to a denial of service.

### libgd2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 7.04
* Ubuntu 6.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Details

A buffer overflow was discovered in libgd2&#39;s font renderer. By tricking an application using libgd2 into rendering a specially crafted string with a JIS encoded font, a remote attacker could read heap memory or crash the application, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-0455](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-0455))

Xavier Roche discovered that libgd2 did not correctly validate PNG callback results. If an application were tricked into processing a specially crafted PNG image, it would monopolize CPU resources. Since libgd2 is often used in PHP and Perl web applications, this could lead to a remote denial of service. ([CVE-2007-2756](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2756))
