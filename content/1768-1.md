### linux-lts-quantal vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-quantal 

### Details

Andrew Cooper of Citrix reported a Xen stack corruption in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged user in a 32bit PVOPS guest can cause the guest kernel to crash, or operate erroneously. ([CVE-2013-0190](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0190))

A failure to validate input was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s Xen netback (network backend) driver. A user in a guest OS may exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service to the guest OS and other guest domains. ([CVE-2013-0216](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0216))

A memory leak was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s Xen netback (network backend) driver. A user in a guest OS could trigger this flaw to cause a denial of service on the system. ([CVE-2013-0217](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0217))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel Xen PCI backend driver. If a PCI device is assigned to the guest OS, the guest OS could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service on the host. ([CVE-2013-0231](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0231))

A flaw was reported in the permission checks done by the Linux kernel for /dev/cpu/*/msr. A local root user with all capabilities dropped could exploit this flaw to execute code with full root capabilities. ([CVE-2013-0268](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0268))

Tommi Rantala discovered a flaw in the a flaw the Linux kernels handling of datagrams packets when the MSG_PEEK flag is specified. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system hang). ([CVE-2013-0290](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0290))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s vhost driver used to accelerate guest networking in KVM based virtual machines. A privileged guest user could exploit this flaw to crash the host system. ([CVE-2013-0311](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0311))

A flaw was discovered in the Extended Verification Module (EVM) of the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user code exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-0313](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0313))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s Bluetooth stack when HIDP (Human Interface Device Protocol) support is enabled. A local unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause an information leak from the kernel. ([CVE-2013-0349](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0349)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-26-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-quantal) <span> [3.5.0-26.42~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-quantal/3.5.0-26.42~precise1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
