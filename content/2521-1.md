### oxide-qt vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.10
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Oxide. 

### Software description

* oxide-qt 

### Details

Several out-of-bounds write bugs were discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1215](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1213">CVE-2015-1213</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1214">CVE-2015-1214</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1215))

A use-after-free was discovered in the V8 bindings in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1216](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1216))

Multiple type confusion bugs were discovered in the V8 bindings in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1230](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1217">CVE-2015-1217</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1230))

Multiple use-after-free bugs were discovered in the DOM implementation in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1223](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1218">CVE-2015-1218</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1223))

An integer overflow was discovered in Skia. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1219](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1219))

A use-after-free was discovered in the GIF image decoder in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1220](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1220))

A use-after-free was discovered in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1221](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1221))

Multiple use-after-free bugs were discovered in the service worker implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1222](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1222))

An out-of-bounds read was discovered in the VPX decoder implementation in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash. ([CVE-2015-1224](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1224))

It was discovered that Blink did not initialize memory for image drawing in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to read uninitialized memory. ([CVE-2015-1227](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1227))

It was discovered that Blink did not initialize memory for a data structure in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-1228](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1228))

It was discovered that a web proxy returning a 407 response could inject cookies in to the originally requested domain. If a user connected to a malicious web proxy, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct session-fixation attacks. ([CVE-2015-1229](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1229))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2015-1231](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-1231))

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2015-2238](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-2238))
