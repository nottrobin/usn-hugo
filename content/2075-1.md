### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 13.10

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

Vasily Kulikov reported a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s implementation of ptrace. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2929](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2929))

Dave Jones and Vince Weaver reported a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s per event subsystem that allows normal users to enable function tracing. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from the kernel. ([CVE-2013-2930](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2930))

Stephan Mueller reported an error in the Linux kernel&#39;s ansi cprng random number generator. This flaw makes it easier for a local attacker to break cryptographic protections. ([CVE-2013-4345](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4345))

Jason Wang discovered a bug in the network flow dissector in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (infinite loop). ([CVE-2013-4348](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4348))

Multiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in the Alchemy LCD frame- buffer drivers in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4511](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4511))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a buffer overflow in the Ozmo Devices USB over WiFi devices. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service or possibly unspecified impact. ([CVE-2013-4513](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4513))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s driver for Agere Systems HERMES II Wireless PC Cards. A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service or possibly gain adminstrative priviliges. ([CVE-2013-4514](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4514))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s driver for Beceem WIMAX chipset based devices. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-4515](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4515))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s driver for the SystemBase Multi-2/PCI serial card. An unprivileged user could obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-4516](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4516))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s debugfs filesystem. An administrative local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (OOPS). ([CVE-2013-6378](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-6378))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the driver for Adaptec AACRAID scsi raid devices in the Linux kernel. A local user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service or possibly other unspecified impact. ([CVE-2013-6380](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-6380))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s compat ioctls for Adaptec AACRAID scsi raid devices. An unprivileged local user could send administrative commands to these devices potentially compromising the data stored on the device. ([CVE-2013-6383](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-6383))

Nico Golde reported a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s userspace IO (uio) driver. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2013-6763](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-6763))

A race condition flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s ipc shared memory implimentation. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly have unspecied other impacts. ([CVE-2013-7026](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-7026)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 13.10
 : [linux-image-3.11.0-15-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.11.0-15.23](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.11.0-15.23) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.11.0-15-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.11.0-15.23](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.11.0-15.23) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
