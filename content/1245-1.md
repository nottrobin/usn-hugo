### linux-mvl-dove vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.10

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-mvl-dove 

### Details

 Ryan Sweat discovered that the kernel incorrectly handled certain VLAN packets. On some systems, a remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1576](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1576))

Vasiliy Kulikov and Dan Rosenberg discovered that ecryptfs did not correctly check the origin of mount points. A local attacker could exploit this to trick the system into unmounting arbitrary mount points, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1833](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1833))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that taskstats did not enforce access restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain information, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2011-2494](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2494))

Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that /proc/PID/io did not enforce access restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain information, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2011-2495](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2495))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the Bluetooth stack incorrectly handled certain L2CAP requests. If a system was using Bluetooth, a remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic to crash the system or gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-2497](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2497))

It was discovered that the EXT4 filesystem contained multiple off-by-one flaws. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2695](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2695))

Fernando Gont discovered that the IPv6 stack used predictable fragment identification numbers. A remote attacker could exploit this to exhaust network resources, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2699](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2699))

Christian Ohm discovered that the perf command looks for configuration files in the current directory. If a privileged user were tricked into running perf in a directory containing a malicious configuration file, an attacker could run arbitrary commands and possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2011-2905](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2905))

Time Warns discovered that long symlinks were incorrectly handled on Be filesystems. A local attacker could exploit this with a malformed Be filesystem and crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2928](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2928))

Dan Kaminsky discovered that the kernel incorrectly handled random sequence number generation. An attacker could use this flaw to possibly predict sequence numbers and inject packets. ([CVE-2011-3188](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3188))

Darren Lavender discovered that the CIFS client incorrectly handled certain large values. A remote attacker with a malicious server could exploit this to crash the system or possibly execute arbitrary code as the root user. ([CVE-2011-3191](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3191))

Han-Wen Nienhuys reported a flaw in the FUSE kernel module. A local user who can mount a FUSE file system could cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-3353](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3353))

Gideon Naim discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s handling VLAN 0 frames. An attacker on the local network could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-3593](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3593)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.10
 : [linux-image-2.6.32-419-dove](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-mvl-dove) <span> [2.6.32-419.37](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-mvl-dove/2.6.32-419.37) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
