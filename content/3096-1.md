### ntp vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in NTP. 

### Software description

* ntp 

### Details

Aanchal Malhotra discovered that NTP incorrectly handled authenticated broadcast mode. A remote attacker could use this issue to perform a replay attack. ([CVE-2015-7973](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7973))

Matt Street discovered that NTP incorrectly verified peer associations of symmetric keys. A remote attacker could use this issue to perform an impersonation attack. ([CVE-2015-7974](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7974))

Jonathan Gardner discovered that the NTP ntpq utility incorrectly handled memory. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause ntpq to crash, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([CVE-2015-7975](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7975))

Jonathan Gardner discovered that the NTP ntpq utility incorrectly handled dangerous characters in filenames. An attacker could possibly use this issue to overwrite arbitrary files. ([CVE-2015-7976](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7976))

Stephen Gray discovered that NTP incorrectly handled large restrict lists. An attacker could use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-7978](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7977">CVE-2015-7977</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7978))

Aanchal Malhotra discovered that NTP incorrectly handled authenticated broadcast mode. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-7979](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-7979))

Jonathan Gardner discovered that NTP incorrectly handled origin timestamp checks. A remote attacker could use this issue to spoof peer servers. ([CVE-2015-8138](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8138))

Jonathan Gardner discovered that the NTP ntpq utility did not properly handle certain incorrect values. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause ntpq to hang, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2015-8158](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-8158))

It was discovered that the NTP cronjob incorrectly cleaned up the statistics directory. A local attacker could possibly use this to escalate privileges. ([CVE-2016-0727](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-0727))

Stephen Gray and Matthew Van Gundy discovered that NTP incorrectly validated crypto-NAKs. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to prevent clients from synchronizing. ([CVE-2016-1547](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1547))

Miroslav Lichvar and Jonathan Gardner discovered that NTP incorrectly handled switching to interleaved symmetric mode. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to prevent clients from synchronizing. ([CVE-2016-1548](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1548))

Matthew Van Gundy, Stephen Gray and Loganaden Velvindron discovered that NTP incorrectly handled message authentication. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to recover the message digest key. ([CVE-2016-1550](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1550))

Yihan Lian discovered that NTP incorrectly handled duplicate IPs on unconfig directives. An authenticated remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2516](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2516))

Yihan Lian discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certail peer associations. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause NTP to crash, resulting in a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-2518](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2518))

Jakub Prokes discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain spoofed packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-4954](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4954))

Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain packets when autokey is enabled. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-4955](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4955))

Miroslav Lichvar discovered that NTP incorrectly handled certain spoofed broadcast packets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2016-4956](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4956))

In the default installation, attackers would be isolated by the NTP AppArmor profile. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
 : [ntp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ntp) <span> [1:4.2.8p4+dfsg-3ubuntu5.3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ntp/1:4.2.8p4+dfsg-3ubuntu5.3) </span> 

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 : [ntp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ntp) <span> [1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-3ubuntu2.14.04.10](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ntp/1:4.2.6.p5+dfsg-3ubuntu2.14.04.10) </span> 

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [ntp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ntp) <span> [1:4.2.6.p3+dfsg-1ubuntu3.11](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ntp/1:4.2.6.p3+dfsg-1ubuntu3.11) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system update will make all the necessary changes.
