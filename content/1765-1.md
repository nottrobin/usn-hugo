    Niels Heinen discovered that multiple modules incorrectly sanitized certain strings, which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks when processing the output. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing server output during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data (such as passwords), within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4558](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3499">CVE-2012-3499</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4558))

### apache2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.10
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 11.10
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the Apache HTTP Server. 

### Software description

* apache2 

### Details

Niels Heinen discovered that multiple modules incorrectly sanitized certain strings, which could result in browsers becoming vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks when processing the output. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing server output during a crafted server request, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents, or steal confidential data (such as passwords), within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4558](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3499">CVE-2012-3499</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4558))

It was discovered that the mod_proxy_ajp module incorrectly handled error states. A remote attacker could use this issue to cause the server to stop responding, resulting in a denial of service. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and Ubuntu 11.10. ([CVE-2012-4557](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4557))

It was discovered that the apache2ctl script shipped in Ubuntu packages incorrectly created the lock directory. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to gain privileges. The symlink protections in Ubuntu 11.10 and later should reduce this vulnerability to a denial of service. ([CVE-2013-1048](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1048))
