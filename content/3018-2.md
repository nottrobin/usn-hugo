### linux-lts-trusty vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-trusty 

### Details

USN-3018-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

Jesse Hertz and Tim Newsham discovered that the Linux netfilter implementation did not correctly perform validation when handling 32 bit compatibility IPT_SO_SET_REPLACE events on 64 bit platforms. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-4997](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4997))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the core USB implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-4482](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4482))

Jann Horn discovered that the InfiniBand interfaces within the Linux kernel could be coerced into overwriting kernel memory. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to possibly gain administrative privileges on systems where InifiniBand related kernel modules are loaded. ([CVE-2016-4565](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4565))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the timer handling implementation in the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture (ALSA) subsystem of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-4578](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4569">CVE-2016-4569</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4578))

Kangjie Lu discovered an information leak in the X.25 Call Request handling in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-4580](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4580))

It was discovered that an information leak exists in the Rock Ridge implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker who is able to mount a malicious iso9660 file system image could exploit this flaw to obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-4913](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4913))

Jesse Hertz and Tim Newsham discovered that the Linux netfilter implementation did not correctly perform validation when handling IPT_SO_SET_REPLACE events. A local unprivileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or obtain potentially sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2016-4998](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-4998)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-91-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty) <span> [3.13.0-91.138~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-91.138~precise1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-91-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty) <span> [3.13.0-91.138~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-91.138~precise1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
