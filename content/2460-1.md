    Christian Holler and Patrick McManus discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.

### Details

Christian Holler and Patrick McManus discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2014-8634](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8634))

Muneaki Nishimura discovered that requests from navigator.sendBeacon() lack an origin header. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct cross-site request forgery (XSRF) attacks. ([CVE-2014-8638](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8638))

Xiaofeng Zheng discovered that a web proxy returning a 407 response could inject cookies in to the originally requested domain. If a user connected to a malicious web proxy, an attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct session-fixation attacks. ([CVE-2014-8639](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-8639))
