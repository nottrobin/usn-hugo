### linux-mvl-dove vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.10

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-mvl-dove 

### Details

Vasily Averin discovered that the NFS Lock Manager (NLM) incorrectly handled unlock requests. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2491](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2491))

Robert Swiecki discovered that mapping extensions were incorrectly handled. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2496](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2496))

It was discovered that the wireless stack incorrectly verified SSID lengths. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service or gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-2517](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2517))

Ben Pfaff discovered that Classless Queuing Disciplines (qdiscs) were being incorrectly handled. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2525](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2525)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.10
 : [linux-image-2.6.32-420-dove](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-mvl-dove) <span> [2.6.32-420.38](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-mvl-dove/2.6.32-420.38) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
