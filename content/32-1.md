### mysql-dfsg vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the MySQL database server.

Lukasz Wojtow discovered a potential buffer overflow in the function mysql_real_connect(). A malicious name server could send specially crafted DNS packages which might result in execution of arbitrary code with the database server&#39;s privileges. However, it is believed that this bug cannot be exploited with the C Standard library (glibc) that Ubuntu uses. (CAN-2004-0836).

Dean Ellis noticed a flaw that allows an authorized MySQL user to cause a denial of service (crash or hang) via concurrent execution of certain statements (ALTER TABLE ... UNION=, FLUSH TABLES) on tables of type MERGE (CAN-2004-0837)

Some query strings containing a double quote (like MATCH ... AGAINST (&#39; some &quot; query&#39; IN BOOLEAN MODE) ) that did not have a matching closing double quote caused a denial of service (server crash). Again, this is only exploitable by authorized mysql users. (CAN-2004-0956)

If a user was granted privileges to a database with a name containing an underscore (&quot;_&quot;), the user also gained the ability to grant privileges to other databases with similar names. (CAN-2004-0957)

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 4.10
 : mysql-server
