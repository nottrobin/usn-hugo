### firefox-3.5, xulrunner-1.9.1 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 9.10

### Software description

* firefox-3.5 

* xulrunner-1.9.1 

### Details

Several flaws were discovered in the browser engine of Firefox. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-0159](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-0159))

Orlando Barrera II discovered a flaw in the Web Workers implementation of Firefox. If a user were tricked into posting to a malicious website, an attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-0160](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-0160))

Alin Rad Pop discovered that Firefox&#39;s HTML parser would incorrectly free memory under certain circumstances. If the browser could be made to access these freed memory objects, an attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2009-1571](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1571))

Hidetake Jo discovered that the showModalDialog in Firefox did not always honor the same-origin policy. An attacker could exploit this to run untrusted JavaScript from other domains. ([CVE-2009-3988](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3988))

Georgi Guninski discovered that the same-origin check in Firefox could be bypassed by utilizing a crafted SVG image. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website, an attacker could exploit this to read data from other domains. ([CVE-2010-0162](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-0162))
