    It was discovered that long transformation matches in libxslt could overflow.  If an attacker were able to make an application linked against libxslt process malicious XSL style sheet input, they could execute arbitrary code with user privileges or cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of serivce.

* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 7.10
* Ubuntu 7.04
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* libxslt 

### Details

It was discovered that long transformation matches in libxslt could overflow. If an attacker were able to make an application linked against libxslt process malicious XSL style sheet input, they could execute arbitrary code with user privileges or cause the application to crash, leading to a denial of serivce. ([CVE-2008-1767](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-1767))

Chris Evans discovered that the RC4 processing code in libxslt did not correctly handle corrupted key information. If a remote attacker were able to make an application linked against libxslt process malicious XML input, they could crash the application, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-2935](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2935))
