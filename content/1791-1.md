    Olli Pettay, Jesse Ruderman, Boris Zbarsky, Christian Holler, Milan Sreckovic and Joe Drew discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting Thunderbird. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.

### Details

Olli Pettay, Jesse Ruderman, Boris Zbarsky, Christian Holler, Milan Sreckovic and Joe Drew discovered multiple memory safety issues affecting Thunderbird. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted message with scripting enabled, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-0788](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0788))

Ambroz Bizjak discovered an out-of-bounds array read in the CERT_DecodeCertPackage function of the Network Security Services (NSS) libary when decoding certain certificates. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash. ([CVE-2013-0791](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0791))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered that timed history navigations could be used to load arbitrary websites with the wrong URL displayed in the addressbar. An attacker could exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) or phishing attacks if scripting were enabled. ([CVE-2013-0793](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0793))

Cody Crews discovered that the cloneNode method could be used to bypass System Only Wrappers (SOW) to clone a protected node and bypass same-origin policy checks. If a user had enabled scripting, an attacker could potentially exploit this to steal confidential data or execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-0795](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0795))

A crash in WebGL rendering was discovered in Thunderbird. An attacker could potentially exploit this to execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird if scripting were enabled. This issue only affects users with Intel graphics drivers. ([CVE-2013-0796](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0796))

Abhishek Arya discovered an out-of-bounds write in the Cairo graphics library. An attacker could potentially exploit this to execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2013-0800](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0800))
