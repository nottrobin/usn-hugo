### linux-fsl-imx51 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-fsl-imx51 

### Details

It was discovered that CIFS incorrectly handled authentication. When a user had a CIFS share mounted that required authentication, a local user could mount the same share without knowing the correct password. ([CVE-2011-1585](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1585))

It was discovered that the GRE protocol incorrectly handled netns initialization. A remote attacker could send a packet while the ip_gre module was loading, and crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1767](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1767))

It was discovered that the IP/IP protocol incorrectly handled netns initialization. A remote attacker could send a packet while the ipip module was loading, and crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1768](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1768))

Vasily Averin discovered that the NFS Lock Manager (NLM) incorrectly handled unlock requests. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2491](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2491)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-2.6.31-612-imx51](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-fsl-imx51) <span> [2.6.31-612.30](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-fsl-imx51/2.6.31-612.30) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
