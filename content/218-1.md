    Two buffer overflows were discovered in the &#39;pnmtopng&#39; tool, which were triggered by processing an image with exactly 256 colors when using the -alpha option ([CVE-2005-3632](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2005-3662">CVE-2005-3662</a>) or by processing a text file with very long lines when using the -text option (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2005-3632)).

### netpbm-free vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04
* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Two buffer overflows were discovered in the &#39;pnmtopng&#39; tool, which were triggered by processing an image with exactly 256 colors when using the -alpha option ([CVE-2005-3632](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2005-3662">CVE-2005-3662</a>) or by processing a text file with very long lines when using the -text option (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2005-3632)).

A remote attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary code by tricking an user or an automated system into processing a specially crafted PNM file with pnmtopng.

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 5.10
