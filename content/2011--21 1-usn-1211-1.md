     It was discovered that the /proc filesystem did not correctly handle permission changes when programs executed. A local attacker could hold open files to examine details about programs running with higher privileges, potentially increasing the chances of exploiting additional vulnerabilities.

### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.04

### Summary

Multiple kernel flaws have been fixed. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

 It was discovered that the /proc filesystem did not correctly handle permission changes when programs executed. A local attacker could hold open files to examine details about programs running with higher privileges, potentially increasing the chances of exploiting additional vulnerabilities. ([CVE-2011-1020](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1020))

Dan Rosenberg discovered that the X.25 Rose network stack did not correctly handle certain fields. If a system was running with Rose enabled, a remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic to gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-1493](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1493))

Vasiliy Kulikov and Dan Rosenberg discovered that ecryptfs did not correctly check the origin of mount points. A local attacker could exploit this to trick the system into unmounting arbitrary mount points, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1833](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1833))

It was discovered that Bluetooth l2cap and rfcomm did not correctly initialize structures. A local attacker could exploit this to read portions of the kernel stack, leading to a loss of privacy. ([CVE-2011-2492](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2492))

It was discovered that GFS2 did not correctly check block sizes. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2689](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2689))

Fernando Gont discovered that the IPv6 stack used predictable fragment identification numbers. A remote attacker could exploit this to exhaust network resources, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2699](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2699))

The performance counter subsystem did not correctly handle certain counters. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-2918](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2918))

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel&#39;s /proc/*/*map* interface. A local, unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-3637](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3637))

Ben Hutchings discovered several flaws in the Linux Rose (X.25 PLP) layer. A local user or a remote user on an X.25 network could exploit these flaws to execute arbitrary code as root. ([CVE-2011-4914](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4914))
