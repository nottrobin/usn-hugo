    Christian Holler, Terrence Cole, Jesse Ruderman, Gary Kwong, Eric Rescorla, Jonathan Kew, Dan Gohman, Ryan VanderMeulen, Carsten Book, Andrew Sutherland, Byron Campen, Nicholas Nethercote, Paul Adenot, David Baron, Julian Seward and Sotaro Ikeda discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox.

Christian Holler, Terrence Cole, Jesse Ruderman, Gary Kwong, Eric Rescorla, Jonathan Kew, Dan Gohman, Ryan VanderMeulen, Carsten Book, Andrew Sutherland, Byron Campen, Nicholas Nethercote, Paul Adenot, David Baron, Julian Seward and Sotaro Ikeda discovered multiple memory safety issues in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1478](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1477">CVE-2014-1477</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1478))

Cody Crews discovered a method to bypass System Only Wrappers. An attacker could potentially exploit this to steal confidential data or execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1479](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1479))

Jordi Chancel discovered that the downloads dialog did not implement a security timeout before button presses are processed. An attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct clickjacking attacks. ([CVE-2014-1480](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1480))

Fredrik LÃ¶nnqvist discovered a use-after-free in Firefox. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1482](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1482))

Jordan Milne discovered a timing flaw when using document.elementFromPoint and document.caretPositionFromPoint on cross-origin iframes. An attacker could potentially exploit this to steal confidential imformation. ([CVE-2014-1483](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1483))

Frederik Braun discovered that the CSP implementation in Firefox did not handle XSLT stylesheets in accordance with the specification, potentially resulting in unexpected script execution in some circumstances ([CVE-2014-1485](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1485))

Arthur Gerkis discovered a use-after-free in Firefox. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1486](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1486))

Masato Kinugawa discovered a cross-origin information leak in web worker error messages. An attacker could potentially exploit this to steal confidential information. ([CVE-2014-1487](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1487))

Yazan Tommalieh discovered that web pages could activate buttons on the default Firefox startpage (about:home) in some circumstances. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause data loss by triggering a session restore. ([CVE-2014-1489](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1489))

Soeren Balko discovered a crash in Firefox when terminating web workers running asm.js code in some circumstances. An attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the priviliges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2014-1488](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1488))

Several issues were discovered with ticket handling in NSS. An attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service or bypass cryptographic protection mechanisms. ([CVE-2014-1491](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1490">CVE-2014-1490</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1491))

Boris Zbarsky discovered that security restrictions on window objects could be bypassed under certain circumstances. ([CVE-2014-1481](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-1481)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 13.10
 : [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox) <span> [27.0+build1-0ubuntu0.13.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox/27.0+build1-0ubuntu0.13.10.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 12.10
 : [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox) <span> [27.0+build1-0ubuntu0.12.10.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox/27.0+build1-0ubuntu0.12.10.1) </span> 

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [firefox](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox) <span> [27.0+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox/27.0+build1-0ubuntu0.12.04.1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to restart Firefox to make all the necessary changes.
