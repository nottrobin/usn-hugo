### openjdk-7 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in OpenJDK 7. 

### Software description

* openjdk-7 

### Details

It was discovered that OpenJDK did not restrict the set of algorithms used for Jar integrity verification. An attacker could use this to modify without detection the content of a JAR file, affecting system integrity. ([CVE-2016-5542](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5542))

It was discovered that the JMX component of OpenJDK did not sufficiently perform classloader consistency checks. An attacker could use this to bypass Java sandbox restrictions. ([CVE-2016-5554](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5554))

It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK did not properly check received Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) packets. An attacker could use this to send debugging commands to a Java application with debugging enabled. ([CVE-2016-5573](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5573))

It was discovered that the Hotspot component of OpenJDK did not properly check arguments of the System.arraycopy() function in certain cases. An attacker could use this to bypass Java sandbox restrictions. ([CVE-2016-5582](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5582))

It was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly handle HTTP proxy authentication. An attacker could use this to expose HTTPS server authentication credentials. ([CVE-2016-5597](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5597))
