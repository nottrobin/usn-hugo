    Multiple memory safety issues were discovered in Firefox.

### firefox vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 13.10
* Ubuntu 13.04
* Ubuntu 12.10
* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

### Software description

* firefox 

### Details

Multiple memory safety issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted page, an attacker could possibly exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-5592](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1739">CVE-2013-1739</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5590">CVE-2013-5590</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5591">CVE-2013-5591</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5592))

Jordi Chancel discovered that HTML select elements could display arbitrary content. An attacker could potentially exploit this to conduct URL spoofing or clickjacking attacks ([CVE-2013-5593](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5593))

Abhishek Arya discovered a crash when processing XSLT data in some circumstances. An attacker could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-5604](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5604))

Dan Gohman discovered a flaw in the Javascript engine. When combined with other vulnerabilities, an attacked could possibly exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-5595](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5595))

Ezra Pool discovered a crash on extremely large pages. An attacked could potentially exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-5596](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5596))

Byoungyoung Lee discovered a use-after-free when updating the offline cache. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-5597](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5597))

Cody Crews discovered a way to append an iframe in to an embedded PDF object displayed with PDF.js. An attacked could potentially exploit this to read local files, leading to information disclosure. ([CVE-2013-5598](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5598))

Multiple use-after-free flaws were discovered in Firefox. An attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-5601](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5599">CVE-2013-5599</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5600">CVE-2013-5600</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5601))

A memory corruption flaw was discovered in the Javascript engine when using workers with direct proxies. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-5602](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5602))

Abhishek Arya discovered a use-after-free when interacting with HTML document templates. An attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking Firefox. ([CVE-2013-5603](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-5603))
