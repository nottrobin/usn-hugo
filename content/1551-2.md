* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 11.10
* Ubuntu 11.04
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

USN-1551-1 introduced regressions in Thunderbird. 

### Software description

### Details

USN-1551-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Thunderbird. The new package caused a regression in the message editor and certain performance regressions as well. This update fixes the problems.

Original advisory details:

 Gary Kwong, Christian Holler, Jesse Ruderman, Steve Fink, Bob Clary, Andrew Sutherland, Jason Smith, John Schoenick, Vladimir Vukicevic and Daniel Holbert discovered memory safety issues affecting Thunderbird. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted E-Mail, an attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. ([CVE-2012-3980](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1970">CVE-2012-1970</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1971">CVE-2012-1971</a>) Abhishek Arya discovered multiple use-after-free vulnerabilities. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted E-Mail, an attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.

This could potentially result in a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against plugins. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted E-Mail, a remote attacker could exploit this to modify the contents or steal confidential data within the same domain. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1956">CVE-2012-1956</a>) Frédéric Hoguin discovered that bitmap format images with a negative height could potentially result in memory corruption. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted image, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3966">CVE-2012-3966</a>) It was discovered that Thunderbird&#39;s WebGL implementation was vulnerable to multiple memory safety issues. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted E-Mail, an attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3967">CVE-2012-3967</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3968">CVE-2012-3968</a>) Arthur Gerkis discovered multiple memory safety issues in Thunderbird&#39;s Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) implementation. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted image, an attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3969">CVE-2012-3969</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3970">CVE-2012-3970</a>) Christoph Diehl discovered multiple memory safety issues in the bundled Graphite 2 library. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted E-Mail, an attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3971">CVE-2012-3971</a>) Nicolas Grégoire discovered an out-of-bounds read in the format-number feature of XSLT. This could potentially cause inaccurate formatting of numbers and information leakage. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3972">CVE-2012-3972</a>) It was discovered that when the DOMParser is used to parse text/html data in a Thunderbird extension, linked resources within this HTML data will be loaded. If the data being parsed in the extension is untrusted, it could lead to information leakage and potentially be combined with other attacks to become exploitable. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3975">CVE-2012-3975</a>) It was discovered that, in some instances, certain security checks in the location object could be bypassed. This could allow for the loading of restricted content and can potentially be combined with other issues to become exploitable. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3978">CVE-2012-3978</a>) Colby Russell discovered that eval in the web console can execute injected code with chrome privileges, leading to the running of malicious code in a privileged context. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted E-Mail, an attacker could exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or potentially execute code with the privileges of the user invoking Thunderbird.
