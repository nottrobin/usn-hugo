### cups, cupsys vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 7.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* cups 

* cupsys 

### Details

It was discovered that CUPS didn&#39;t properly handle adding a large number of RSS subscriptions. A local user could exploit this and cause CUPS to crash, leading to a denial of service. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 7.10, 8.04 LTS and 8.10. ([CVE-2008-5183](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5183))

It was discovered that CUPS did not authenticate users when adding and cancelling RSS subscriptions. An unprivileged local user could bypass intended restrictions and add a large number of RSS subscriptions. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 7.10 and 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2008-5184](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5184))

It was discovered that the PNG filter in CUPS did not properly handle certain malformed images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted PNG image file, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code with user privileges. In Ubuntu 7.10, 8.04 LTS, and 8.10, attackers would be isolated by the AppArmor CUPS profile. ([CVE-2008-5286](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5286))

It was discovered that the example pstopdf CUPS filter created log files in an insecure way. Local users could exploit a race condition to create or overwrite files with the privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only applied to Ubuntu 6.06 LTS, 7.10, and 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2008-5377](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-5377))
