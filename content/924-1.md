### krb5 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 9.04
* Ubuntu 8.10
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Software description

* krb5 

### Details

Sol Jerome discovered that the Kerberos kadmind service did not correctly free memory. An unauthenticated remote attacker could send specially crafted traffic to crash the kadmind process, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2010-0629](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-0629))

It was discovered that Kerberos did not correctly free memory in the GSSAPI library. If a remote attacker were able to manipulate an application using GSSAPI carefully, the service could crash, leading to a denial of service. (Ubuntu 8.10 was not affected.) ([CVE-2007-5971](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-5901">CVE-2007-5901</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-5971))

It was discovered that Kerberos did not correctly free memory in the GSSAPI and kdb libraries. If a remote attacker were able to manipulate an application using these libraries carefully, the service could crash, leading to a denial of service. (Only Ubuntu 8.04 LTS was affected.) ([CVE-2007-5972](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-5902">CVE-2007-5902</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-5972))
