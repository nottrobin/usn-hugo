    Tavis Ormandy found an integer overflow in the Binary File Descriptor (BFD) parser in the GNU debugger. The same vulnerable code is also present in binutils. By tricking an user into processing a specially crafted executable with the binutils tools (strings, objdump, nm, readelf, etc.), an attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the affected program.
