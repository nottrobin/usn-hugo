description: |
    Chris Evans and Marcus Meissner recently discovered several integer overflow vulnerabilities in xpdf, a viewer for PDF files. Because tetex-bin contains xpdf code, it is also affected. These vulnerabilities could be exploited by an attacker providing a specially crafted TeX, LaTeX, or PDF file. Processing such a file with pdflatex could result in abnormal program termination or the execution of program code supplied by the attacker.
