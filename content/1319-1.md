### linux-ti-omap4 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 11.04

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

Peter Huewe discovered an information leak in the handling of reading security-related TPM data. A local, unprivileged user could read the results of a previous TPM command. ([CVE-2011-1162](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1162))

Clement Lecigne discovered a bug in the HFS filesystem. A local attacker could exploit this to cause a kernel oops. ([CVE-2011-2203](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2203))

A flaw was found in how the Linux kernel handles user-defined key types. An unprivileged local user could exploit this to crash the system. ([CVE-2011-4110](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4110)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 11.04
 : [linux-image-2.6.38-1209-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [2.6.38-1209.19](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/2.6.38-1209.19) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
