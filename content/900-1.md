### ruby1.9 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 9.10
* Ubuntu 9.04
* Ubuntu 8.10

### Software description

* ruby1.9 

### Details

Emmanouel Kellinis discovered that Ruby did not properly handle certain string operations. An attacker could exploit this issue and possibly execute arbitrary code with application privileges. ([CVE-2009-4124](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-4124))

Giovanni Pellerano, Alessandro Tanasi, and Francesco Ongaro discovered that Ruby did not properly sanitize data written to log files. An attacker could insert specially-crafted data into log files which could affect certain terminal emulators and cause arbitrary files to be overwritten, or even possibly execute arbitrary commands. ([CVE-2009-4492](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-4492))

It was discovered that Ruby did not properly handle string arguments that represent large numbers. An attacker could exploit this and cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 9.10. ([CVE-2009-1904](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-1904))
