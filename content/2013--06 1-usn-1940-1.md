### linux-ec2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ec2 

### Details

Vasily Kulikov discovered a flaw in the Linux Kernel&#39;s perf tool that allows for privilege escalation. A local user could exploit this flaw to run commands as root when using the perf tool. ([CVE-2013-1060](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1060))

Michael S. Tsirkin discovered a flaw in how the Linux kernel&#39;s KVM subsystem allocates memory slots for the guest&#39;s address space. A local user could exploit this flaw to gain system privileges or obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-1943](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1943))

A flaw was discovered in the SCTP (stream control transfer protocol) network protocol&#39;s handling of duplicate cookies in the Linux kernel. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) on another remote user querying the SCTP connection. ([CVE-2013-2206](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2206))

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in setsockopt UDP_CORK option in the Linux kernel&#39;s IPv6 stack. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-4162](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4162)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-2.6.32-356-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2) <span> [2.6.32-356.69](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2/2.6.32-356.69) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
