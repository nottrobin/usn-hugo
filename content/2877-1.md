### oxide-qt vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 15.10
* Ubuntu 15.04
* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Oxide. 

### Software description

* oxide-qt 

### Details

A bad cast was discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2016-1612](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1612))

An issue was discovered when initializing the UnacceleratedImageBufferSurface class in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-1614](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1614))

An issue was discovered with the CSP implementation in Blink. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit this to determine whether specific HSTS sites had been visited by reading a CSP report. ([CVE-2016-1617](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1617))

An issue was discovered with random number generator in Blink. An attacker could potentially exploit this to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms. ([CVE-2016-1618](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1618))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Chromium. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via application crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2016-1620](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-1620))

Multiple security issues were discovered in V8. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to read uninitialized memory, cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2016-2051](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2051))

Multiple security issues were discovered in Harfbuzz. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via renderer crash or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the sandboxed render process. ([CVE-2016-2052](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2052))
