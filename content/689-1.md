    Alfredo Ortega discovered a flaw in Vinagre&#39;s use of format strings. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability if they tricked a user into connecting to a malicious VNC server, or opening a specially crafted URI with Vinagre. In Ubuntu 8.04, it was possible to execute arbitrary code with user privileges. In Ubuntu 8.10, Vinagre would simply abort, leading to a denial of service.
