### autofs vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.10

### Summary

autofs could be made to run programs as an administrator if program maps were configured.

### Software description

* autofs 

### Details

It was discovered that autofs incorrectly filtered environment variables when using program maps. When program maps were configured, a local user could use this issue to escalate privileges.

This update changes the default behaviour by adding a prefix to environment variables. Sites using program maps will need to adapt to the new variable names, or revert to the previous names by using a new configuration option called FORCE_STANDARD_PROGRAM_MAP_ENV. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 14.10
 : [autofs](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/autofs) <span> [5.0.8-1ubuntu1.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/autofs/5.0.8-1ubuntu1.1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.
