### grub2 vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 9.10

### Software description

* grub2 

### Details

It was discovered that GRUB 2 did not properly validate passwords. An attacker with physical access could conduct a brute force attack and bypass authentication by submitting a 1 character password. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 9.10
 : [grub2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2) <span> [1.97~beta4-1ubuntu4.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2/1.97~beta4-1ubuntu4.1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

In general, a standard system upgrade is sufficient to effect the necessary changes.

Users who have upgraded from GRUB Legacy to GRUB 2 and did not run &#39;upgrade-from-grub-legacy&#39; (ie those who are still using Grub Legacy to chainload into GRUB 2) will have to run the following command (possibly adjusting &#39;hd0&#39;) to update GRUB 2&#39;s on disk core image:

$ sudo grub-install --no-floppy --grub-setup=/bin/true &quot;(hd0)&quot;
