### openssl vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 9.10
* Ubuntu 9.04
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* openssl 

### Details

Marsh Ray and Steve Dispensa discovered a flaw in the TLS and SSLv3 protocols. If an attacker could perform a man in the middle attack at the start of a TLS connection, the attacker could inject arbitrary content at the beginning of the user&#39;s session. This update adds backported support for the new RFC5746 renegotiation extension and will use it when both the client and the server support it.

ATTENTION: After applying this update, a patched server will allow both patched and unpatched clients to connect, but unpatched clients will not be able to renegotiate. For more information, please refer to the following: http://www.openssl.org/docs/ssl/SSL_CTX_set_options.html#SECURE_RENEGOTIATION
