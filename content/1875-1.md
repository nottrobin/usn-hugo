    Eoghan Glynn and Alex Meade discovered that Keystone did not properly perform expiry checks for the PKI tokens used in Keystone. If Keystone were setup to use PKI tokens, a previously authenticated user could continue to use a PKI token for longer than intended. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.10 which does not use PKI tokens by default. ([CVE-2013-2104](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2104))

### keystone vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 13.04
* Ubuntu 12.10

### Summary

Keystone did not always properly verify expired PKI tokens or properly authenticate users.

### Software description

* keystone 

### Details

Eoghan Glynn and Alex Meade discovered that Keystone did not properly perform expiry checks for the PKI tokens used in Keystone. If Keystone were setup to use PKI tokens, a previously authenticated user could continue to use a PKI token for longer than intended. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.10 which does not use PKI tokens by default. ([CVE-2013-2104](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2104))

Jose Castro Leon discovered that Keystone did not properly authenticate users when using the LDAP backend. An attacker could obtain valid tokens and impersonate other users by supplying an empty password. By default, Ubuntu does not use the LDAP backend. ([CVE-2013-2157](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2157))
