### linux-ec2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ec2 

### Details

Stephan Mueller reported an error in the Linux kernel&#39;s ansi cprng random number generator. This flaw makes it easier for a local attacker to break cryptographic protections. ([CVE-2013-4345](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4345))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s IP Virtual Server (IP_VS) support. A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could exploit this flaw to gain additional administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4588](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4588))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s debugfs filesystem. An administrative local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (OOPS). ([CVE-2013-6378](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-6378))

Nico Golde reported a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s userspace IO (uio) driver. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2013-6763](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-6763)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-2.6.32-360-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2) <span> [2.6.32-360.73](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2/2.6.32-360.73) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
