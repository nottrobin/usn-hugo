### php5 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 11.10
* Ubuntu 11.04
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in PHP. 

### Software description

* php5 

### Details

It was discovered that PHP incorrectly handled certain Tidy::diagnose operations on invalid objects. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause PHP to crash, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2012-0781](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0781))

It was discovered that PHP incorrectly handled certain multi-file upload filenames. A remote attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service, or to perform a directory traversal attack. ([CVE-2012-1172](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1172))

Rubin Xu and Joseph Bonneau discovered that PHP incorrectly handled certain Unicode characters in passwords passed to the crypt() function. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to bypass authentication. ([CVE-2012-2143](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2143))

It was discovered that a Debian/Ubuntu specific patch caused PHP to incorrectly handle empty salt strings. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to bypass authentication. This issue only affected Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and Ubuntu 11.04. ([CVE-2012-2317](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2317))

It was discovered that PHP, when used as a stand alone CGI processor for the Apache Web Server, did not properly parse and filter query strings. This could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code running with the privilege of the web server, or to perform a denial of service. Configurations using mod_php5 and FastCGI were not vulnerable. ([CVE-2012-2336](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2335">CVE-2012-2335</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2336))

Alexander Gavrun discovered that the PHP Phar extension incorrectly handled certain malformed TAR files. A remote attacker could use this flaw to perform a denial of service, or possibly execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2012-2386](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-2386))
