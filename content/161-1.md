### bzip2 vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.04
* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

USN-158-1 fixed a command injection vulnerability in the &quot;zgrep&quot; utility. It was determined that the &quot;bzgrep&quot; counterpart in the bzip2 package is vulnerable to the same flaw.

bzgrep did not handle shell metacharacters like &#39;|&#39; and &#39;&amp;&#39; properly when they occurred in input file names. This could be exploited to execute arbitrary commands with user privileges if bzgrep was run in an untrusted directory with specially crafted file names.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 5.04
 : bzip2 

Ubuntu 4.10
