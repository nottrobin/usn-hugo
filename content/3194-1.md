    Karthik Bhargavan and Gaetan Leurent discovered that the DES and Triple DES ciphers were vulnerable to birthday attacks.  A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to obtain clear text data from long encrypted sessions. This update moves those algorithms to the legacy algorithm set and causes them to be used only if no non-legacy algorithms can be negotiated.

### openjdk-7 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in OpenJDK 7. 

### Software description

* openjdk-7 

### Details

Karthik Bhargavan and Gaetan Leurent discovered that the DES and Triple DES ciphers were vulnerable to birthday attacks. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw to obtain clear text data from long encrypted sessions. This update moves those algorithms to the legacy algorithm set and causes them to be used only if no non-legacy algorithms can be negotiated. ([CVE-2016-2183](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-2183))

It was discovered that OpenJDK accepted ECSDA signatures using non-canonical DER encoding. An attacker could use this to modify or expose sensitive data. ([CVE-2016-5546](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5546))

It was discovered that OpenJDK did not properly verify object identifier (OID) length when reading Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) records, as used in x.509 certificates and elsewhere. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory consumption). ([CVE-2016-5547](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5547))

It was discovered that covert timing channel vulnerabilities existed in the DSA implementations in OpenJDK. A remote attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-5548](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5548))

It was discovered that the URLStreamHandler class in OpenJDK did not properly parse user information from a URL. A remote attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2016-5552](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5552))

It was discovered that the URLClassLoader class in OpenJDK did not properly check access control context when downloading class files. A remote attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2017-3231](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-3231))

It was discovered that the Remote Method Invocation (RMI) implementation in OpenJDK performed deserialization of untrusted inputs. A remote attacker could use this to execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2017-3241](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-3241))

It was discovered that the Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) component of OpenJDK did not properly perform user search LDAP queries. An attacker could use a specially constructed LDAP entry to expose or modify sensitive information. ([CVE-2017-3252](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-3252))

It was discovered that the PNGImageReader class in OpenJDK did not properly handle iTXt and zTXt chunks. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (memory consumption). ([CVE-2017-3253](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-3253))

It was discovered that integer overflows existed in the SocketInputStream and SocketOutputStream classes of OpenJDK. An attacker could use this to expose sensitive information. ([CVE-2017-3261](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-3261))

It was discovered that the atomic field updaters in the java.util.concurrent.atomic package in OpenJDK did not properly restrict access to protected field members. An attacker could use this to specially craft a Java application or applet that could bypass Java sandbox restrictions. ([CVE-2017-3272](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-3272))

It was discovered that a vulnerability existed in the class construction implementation in OpenJDK. An attacker could use this to specially craft a Java application or applet that could bypass Java sandbox restrictions. ([CVE-2017-3289](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2017-3289)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:
