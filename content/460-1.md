### samba vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 7.04
* Ubuntu 6.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Details

Paul Griffith and Andrew Hogue discovered that Samba did not fully drop root privileges while translating SIDs. A remote authenticated user could issue SMB operations during a small window of opportunity and gain root privileges. ([CVE-2007-2444](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2444))

Brian Schafer discovered that Samba did not handle NDR parsing correctly. A remote attacker could send specially crafted MS-RPC requests that could overwrite heap memory and execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2007-2446](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2446))

It was discovered that Samba did not correctly escape input parameters for external scripts defined in smb.conf. Remote authenticated users could send specially crafted MS-RPC requests and execute arbitrary shell commands. ([CVE-2007-2447](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2447))
