### Linux kernel (OMAP4) vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.10

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ti-omap4 

### Details

Aristide Fattori and Roberto Paleari reported a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s handling of IPv4 icmp packets. A remote user could exploit this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1927](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1927))

Vegard Nossum discovered a leak in the kernel&#39;s inotify_init() system call. A local, unprivileged user could exploit this to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2010-4250](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4250))

An error was discovered in the kernel&#39;s handling of CUSE (Character device in Userspace). A local attacker might exploit this flaw to escalate privilege, if access to /dev/cuse has been modified to allow non-root users. ([CVE-2010-4650](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4650))

A flaw was found in the kernel&#39;s Integrity Measurement Architecture (IMA). Changes made by an attacker might not be discovered by IMA, if SELinux was disabled, and a new IMA rule was loaded. ([CVE-2011-0006](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0006))

A flaw was found in the Linux Ethernet bridge&#39;s handling of IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) packets. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to crash the system. ([CVE-2011-0716](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0716))

Dan Rosenberg reported errors in the OSS (Open Sound System) MIDI interface. A local attacker on non-x86 systems might be able to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-1476](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1476))

Dan Rosenberg reported errors in the kernel&#39;s OSS (Open Sound System) driver for Yamaha FM synthesizer chips. A local user can exploit this to cause memory corruption, causing a denial of service or privilege escalation. ([CVE-2011-1477](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1477))

Dan Rosenberg reported an error in the old ABI compatibility layer of ARM kernels. A local attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service or gain root privileges. ([CVE-2011-1759](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-1759))

Ben Hutchings reported a flaw in the kernel&#39;s handling of corrupt LDM partitions. A local user could exploit this to cause a denial of service or escalate privileges. ([CVE-2011-2182](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-2182))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s AppArmor security interface when invalid information was written to it. An unprivileged local user could use this to cause a denial of service on the system. ([CVE-2011-3619](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-3619))

It was discovered that some import kernel threads can be blocked by a user level process. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2011-4621](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4621))

A flaw was discovered in the XFS filesystem. If a local user mounts a specially crafted XFS image it could potential execute arbitrary code on the system. ([CVE-2012-0038](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0038))

Chen Haogang discovered an integer overflow that could result in memory corruption. A local unprivileged user could use this to crash the system. ([CVE-2012-0044](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0044)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.10
 : [linux-image-2.6.35-903-omap4](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4) <span> [2.6.35-903.32](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ti-omap4/2.6.35-903.32) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.
