### linux-raspi2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 16.10

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-raspi2 

### Details

CAI Qian discovered that shared bind mounts in a mount namespace exponentially added entries without restriction to the Linux kernel&#39;s mount table. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-6213](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-6213))

Andreas Gruenbacher and Jan Kara discovered that the filesystem implementation in the Linux kernel did not clear the setgid bit during a setxattr call. A local attacker could use this to possibly elevate group privileges. ([CVE-2016-7097](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-7097))

Marco Grassi discovered that the driver for Areca RAID Controllers in the Linux kernel did not properly validate control messages. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2016-7425](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-7425))

It was discovered that the KVM implementation for x86/x86_64 in the Linux kernel could dereference a null pointer. An attacker in a guest virtual machine could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) in the KVM host. ([CVE-2016-8630](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-8630))

Eyal Itkin discovered that the IP over IEEE 1394 (FireWire) implementation in the Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow when handling fragmented packets. A remote attacker could use this to possibly execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges. ([CVE-2016-8633](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-8633))

Marco Grassi discovered that the TCP implementation in the Linux kernel mishandles socket buffer (skb) truncation. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-8645](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-8645))

It was discovered that the keyring implementation in the Linux kernel improperly handled crypto registration in conjunction with successful key- type registration. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-9313](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-9313))

Andrey Konovalov discovered that the SCTP implementation in the Linux kernel improperly handled validation of incoming data. A remote attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-9555](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-9555)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 16.10
 : [linux-image-4.8.0-1021-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-raspi2) <span> [4.8.0-1021.24](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-raspi2/4.8.0-1021.24) </span> 
 : [linux-image-raspi2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-raspi2) <span> [4.8.0.1021.24](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-raspi2/4.8.0-1021.24) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
