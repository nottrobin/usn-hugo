    Two integer overflows have been discovered in the XPM image loader of the GDK pixbuf library. By tricking an user into opening a specially crafted XPM image with any Gnome desktop application that uses this library, this could be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application.

### gtk+2.0, gdk-pixbuf vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.10
* Ubuntu 5.04
* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Two integer overflows have been discovered in the XPM image loader of the GDK pixbuf library. By tricking an user into opening a specially crafted XPM image with any Gnome desktop application that uses this library, this could be exploited to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running the application. ([CVE-2005-3186](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2005-2976">CVE-2005-2976</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2005-3186))

Additionally, specially crafted XPM images could cause an endless loop in the image loader, which could be exploited to cause applications trying to open that image to hang. ([CVE-2005-2975](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2005-2975))
