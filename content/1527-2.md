A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 11.10
* Ubuntu 11.04
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Software description

* xmlrpc-c 

### Details

USN-1527-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Expat. This update provides the corresponding updates for XML-RPC for C and C++. Both issues described in the original advisory affected XML-RPC for C and C++ in Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, 11.04, 11.10 and 12.04 LTS.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that Expat computed hash values without restricting the ability to trigger hash collisions predictably. If a user or application linked against Expat were tricked into opening a crafted XML file, an attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive CPU resources. ([CVE-2012-1148](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-0876">CVE-2012-0876</a>) Tim Boddy discovered that Expat did not properly handle memory reallocation when processing XML files. If a user or application linked against Expat were tricked into opening a crafted XML file, an attacker could cause a denial of service by consuming excessive memory resources. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS, 10.04 LTS, 11.04 and 11.10. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-1148))
