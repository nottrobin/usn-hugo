If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5257](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5257))

Atte Kettunen discovered a heap buffer overflow during text conversion with some unicode characters. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5270](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5270))

Abhishek Arya discovered a bad cast when processing layout with input elements in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5272](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5272))

A use-after-free was discovered in web animations during restyling. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5274](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5274))

A use-after-free was discovered in accessibility. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5276](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5276))

A use-after-free was discovered in web animations when destroying a timeline. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5277](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5277))

A buffer overflow was discovered when encoding image frames to images in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted message, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5278](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5278))

Mei Wang discovered a use-after-free when changing text direction. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5280](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5280))

Brian Carpenter discovered a use-after-free when manipulating SVG content in some circumstances. If a user were tricked in to opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context, an attacker could potentially exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code. ([CVE-2016-5281](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5281))

An issue was discovered with the preloaded Public Key Pinning (HPKP). If a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker was able to obtain a fraudulent certificate for a Mozilla site, they could exploit this by providing malicious addon updates. ([CVE-2016-5284](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-5284))
