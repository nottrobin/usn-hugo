### icu vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

ICU could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it processed specially crafted data. 

### Software description

* icu 

### Details

USN-2522-1 fixed vulnerabilities in ICU. On Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, the font patches caused a regression when using LibreOffice Calc. The patches have now been updated to fix the regression.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that ICU incorrectly handled memory operations when processing fonts. If an application using ICU processed crafted data, an attacker could cause it to crash or potentially execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. ([CVE-2014-7940](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1569">CVE-2013-1569</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2383">CVE-2013-2383</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2384">CVE-2013-2384</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2419">CVE-2013-2419</a>) It was discovered that ICU incorrectly handled memory operations when processing fonts.
