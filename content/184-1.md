### util-linux vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 5.04
* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

David Watson discovered that &quot;umount -r&quot; removed some restrictive mount options like the &quot;nosuid&quot; flag. If /etc/fstab contains user-mountable removable devices which specify the &quot;nosuid&quot; flag (which is common practice for such devices), a local attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary programs with root privileges by calling &quot;umount -r&quot; on a removable device.

This does not affect the default Ubuntu configuration. Since Ubuntu mounts removable devices automatically, there is normally no need to configure them manually in /etc/fstab.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 5.04
 : mount 

Ubuntu 4.10
 : mount 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

None
