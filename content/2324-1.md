### Details

Steven Hardy discovered that OpenStack Keystone did not properly handle chained delegation. A remove authenticated attacker could use this to gain privileges by creating a new token with additional roles. ([CVE-2014-3476](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3476))

Jamie Lennox discovered that OpenStack Keystone did not properly validate the project id. A remote authenticated attacker may be able to use this to access other projects. ([CVE-2014-3520](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3520))

Brant Knudson and Lance Bragstad discovered that OpenStack Keystone would not always revoke tokens correctly. If Keystone were configured to use revocation events, a remote authenticated attacker could continue to have access to resources. ([CVE-2014-5253](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-5251">CVE-2014-5251</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-5252">CVE-2014-5252</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-5253))
