### linux-lts-trusty vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-trusty 

### Details

USN-3160-1 fixed vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux Hardware Enablement (HWE) kernel from Ubuntu 14.04 LTS for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS.

CAI Qian discovered that shared bind mounts in a mount namespace exponentially added entries without restriction to the Linux kernel&#39;s mount table. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2016-6213](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-6213))

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the procfs environ_read function in the Linux kernel, leading to an integer underflow. A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). ([CVE-2016-7916](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2016-7916)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-106-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty) <span> [3.13.0-106.153~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-106.153~precise1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-generic-lpae-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty) <span> [3.13.0.106.97](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-106.153~precise1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-106-generic-lpae](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty) <span> [3.13.0-106.153~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-106.153~precise1) </span> 
 : [linux-image-generic-lts-trusty](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty) <span> [3.13.0.106.97](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-trusty/3.13.0-106.153~precise1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-generic-lts-RELEASE, linux-virtual, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
