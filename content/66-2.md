### php4 vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

Ubuntu Security Notice USN-66-1 described a circumvention of the &quot;open_basedir&quot; restriction by using the cURL module. Adam Conrad discovered that the fix from USN-66-1 still allowed to bypass this restriction with certain variants of path specifications.

In addition this update fixes the crash of the PHP interpreter if curl_init() was called without parameters.

For reference, this is the relevant part of the original advisory:

 FraMe from kernelpanik.org reported that the cURL module does not respect open_basedir restrictions. As a result, scripts which used cURL to open files with an user-specified path could read arbitrary local files outside of the open_basedir directory.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 4.10
 : libapache2-mod-php4 
 : php4-cgi 
 : php4-curl 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

None
