Havoc Pennington discovered that the D-Bus daemon did not correctly validate certain security policies. If a local user sent a specially crafted D-Bus request, they could bypass security policies that had a &quot;send_interface&quot; defined. ([CVE-2008-0595](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0595))

If a local user sent a specially crafted D-Bus request, they could crash applications linked against the D-Bus library, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2008-3834](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3834))
