    It was discovered that Ghostscript did not correctly handle memory allocation when parsing certain malformed JPEG-2000 images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted image, an attacker could cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges.

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.10
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS

### Summary

Ghostscript could be made to crash or run programs as your login if it opened a specially crafted file.

### Software description

* ghostscript 

### Details

It was discovered that Ghostscript did not correctly handle memory allocation when parsing certain malformed JPEG-2000 images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted image, an attacker could cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-3520](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3520))

It was discovered that Ghostscript did not correctly handle certain formatting operations when parsing JPEG-2000 images. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted image, an attacker could cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2008-3522](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-3522))

It was discovered that Ghostscript incorrectly handled certain malformed TrueType fonts. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a document containing a specially crafted font, an attacker could cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2009-3743](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3743))

It was discovered that Ghostscript incorrectly handled certain malformed Type 2 fonts. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a document containing a specially crafted font, an attacker could cause a denial of service and possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. This issue only affected Ubuntu 8.04 LTS. ([CVE-2010-4054](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-4054))

Jonathan Foote discovered that Ghostscript incorrectly handled certain malformed JPEG-2000 image files. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a specially crafted JPEG-2000 image file, an attacker could cause Ghostscript to crash or possibly execute arbitrary code with user privileges. ([CVE-2011-4517](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4516">CVE-2011-4516</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-4517))
