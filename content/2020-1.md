     An information leak was discovered in the handling of ICMPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) messages in the Linux kernel&#39;s IPv6 network stack. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (excessive retries and address-generation outage), and consequently obtain sensitive information.

### linux-lts-raring vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-lts-raring 

### Details

 An information leak was discovered in the handling of ICMPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) messages in the Linux kernel&#39;s IPv6 network stack. A remote attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (excessive retries and address-generation outage), and consequently obtain sensitive information. ([CVE-2013-0343](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0343))

Dan Carpenter discovered an information leak in the HP Smart Array and Compaq SMART2 disk-array driver in the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2147](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2147))

Kees Cook discovered flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem when CONFIG_HID_ZEROPLUS is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2889](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2889))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of the Linux kernel when any of CONFIG_LOGITECH_FF, CONFIG_LOGIG940_FF, or CONFIG_LOGIWHEELS_FF are enabled. A physcially proximate attacker can leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service vias a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2893](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2893))

Kees Cook discovered a flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG_HID_LENOVO_TPKBD is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2894](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2894))

Kees Cook discovered another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG_HID_LOGITECH_DJ is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could cause a denial of service (OOPS) or obtain sensitive information from kernel memory via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2895](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2895))

Kees Cook discovered yet another flaw in the Human Interface Device (HID) subsystem of the Linux kernel when CONFIG_HID_MULTITOUCH is enabled. A physically proximate attacker could leverage this flaw to cause a denial of service (OOPS) via a specially crafted device. ([CVE-2013-2897](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2897))

Miroslav Vadkerti discovered a flaw in how the permissions for network sysctls are handled in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to have privileged access to files in /proc/sys/net/. ([CVE-2013-4270](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4270))

Wannes Rombouts reported a vulnerability in the networking tuntap interface of the Linux kernel. A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could leverage this flaw to gain full admin privileges. ([CVE-2013-4343](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4343)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.8.0-33-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-raring) <span> [3.8.0-33.48~precise1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-lts-raring/3.8.0-33.48~precise1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
