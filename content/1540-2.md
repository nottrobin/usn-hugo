### Summary

### Software description

### Details

Original advisory details:

 Kaspar Brand discovered a vulnerability in how the Network Security Services (NSS) ASN.1 decoder handles zero length items. If the user were tricked into opening a specially crafted certificate, an attacker could possibly exploit this to cause a denial of service via application crash. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
 : [libnss3](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nss) <span> [3.13.1.with.ckbi.1.88-1ubuntu6.1](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nss/3.13.1.with.ckbi.1.88-1ubuntu6.1) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to restart any applications that use NSS, such as Evolution, to make all the necessary changes.
