### linux vulnerability

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 12.10

### Summary

The system could be made to run programs as an administrator. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

 Suleiman Souhlal, Salman Qazi, Aaron Durbin and Michael Davidson discovered a race condition in the Linux kernel&#39;s ptrace syscall. An unprivileged local attacker could exploit this flaw to run programs as an administrator. ([CVE-2013-0871](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-0871))

A flaw was discovered in the Edgeort USB serial converter driver when the device is disconnected while it is in use. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-1774](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-1774))

A flaw was discovered in the ChipIdea Highspeed Dual Role and ChipIdea host controller drivers in the Linux kernel. A local user could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). ([CVE-2013-2058](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2058)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 12.10
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-25-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-25.38](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-25.38) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-25-omap](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-25.38](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-25.38) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-25-powerpc-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-25.38](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-25.38) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-25-highbank](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-25.38](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-25.38) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.5.0-25-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.5.0-25.38](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.5.0-25.38) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
