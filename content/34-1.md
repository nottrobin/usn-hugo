### openssh information leakage

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

@Mediaservice.net discovered two information leaks in the OpenSSH server. When using password authentication, an attacker could test whether a login name exists by measuring the time between failed login attempts, i. e. the time after which the &quot;password:&quot; prompt appears again.

A similar issue affects systems which do not allow root logins over ssh (&quot;PermitRootLogin no&quot;). By measuring the time between login attempts an attacker could check whether a given root password is correct. This allowed determining weak root passwords using a brute force attack.

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 4.10
 : openssh-server 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

None
