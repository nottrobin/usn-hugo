### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 13.04

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s UDP Fragmentation Offload (UFO). An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4470](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4470))

Multiple integer overflow flaws were discovered in the Alchemy LCD frame- buffer drivers in the Linux kernel. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-4511](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4511))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a buffer overflow in the Ozmo Devices USB over WiFi devices. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service or possibly unspecified impact. ([CVE-2013-4513](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4513))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s driver for Agere Systems HERMES II Wireless PC Cards. A local user with the CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service or possibly gain adminstrative priviliges. ([CVE-2013-4514](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4514))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s driver for Beceem WIMAX chipset based devices. An unprivileged local user could exploit this flaw to obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-4515](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4515))

Nico Golde and Fabian Yamaguchi reported a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s driver for the SystemBase Multi-2/PCI serial card. An unprivileged user could obtain sensitive information from kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-4516](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-4516))

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s compat ioctls for Adaptec AACRAID scsi raid devices. An unprivileged local user could send administrative commands to these devices potentially compromising the data stored on the device. ([CVE-2013-6383](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-6383))

Nico Golde reported a flaw in the Linux kernel&#39;s userspace IO (uio) driver. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory corruption) or possibly gain privileges. ([CVE-2013-6763](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-6763))

Evan Huus reported a buffer overflow in the Linux kernel&#39;s radiotap header parsing. A remote attacker could cause a denial of service (buffer over- read) via a specially crafted header. ([CVE-2013-7027](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-7027)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 13.04
 : [linux-image-3.8.0-35-generic](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.8.0-35.50](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.8.0-35.50) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
