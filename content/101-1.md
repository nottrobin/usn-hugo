    A buffer overflow was discovered in the telnet client&#39;s handling of the LINEMODE suboptions. By sending a specially constructed reply containing a large number of SLC (Set Local Character) commands, a remote attacker (i. e. a malicious telnet server) could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running the telnet client.

### netkit-telnet vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 4.10

### Details

A buffer overflow was discovered in the telnet client&#39;s handling of the LINEMODE suboptions. By sending a specially constructed reply containing a large number of SLC (Set Local Character) commands, a remote attacker (i. e. a malicious telnet server) could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the user running the telnet client. (CAN-2005-0469)

Michal Zalewski discovered a Denial of Service vulnerability in the telnet server (telnetd). A remote attacker could cause the telnetd process to free an invalid pointer, which caused the server process to crash, leading to a denial of service (inetd will disable the service if telnetd crashed repeatedly), or possibly the execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the telnetd process (by default, the &#39;telnetd&#39; user). Please note that the telnet server is not officially supported by Ubuntu, it is in the &quot;universe&quot; component. (CAN-2004-0911)

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 4.10
 : telnetd 
 : telnet 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).
