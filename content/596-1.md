    Chris Clark discovered that Ruby&#39;s HTTPS module did not check for commonName mismatches early enough during SSL negotiation.  If a remote attacker were able to perform man-in-the-middle attacks, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive information in HTTPS requests coming from Ruby applications.

### ruby1.8 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 7.10
* Ubuntu 7.04
* Ubuntu 6.10
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* ruby1.8 

### Details

Chris Clark discovered that Ruby&#39;s HTTPS module did not check for commonName mismatches early enough during SSL negotiation. If a remote attacker were able to perform man-in-the-middle attacks, this flaw could be exploited to view sensitive information in HTTPS requests coming from Ruby applications. ([CVE-2007-5162](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-5162))

It was discovered that Ruby&#39;s FTPTLS, telnets, and IMAPS modules did not check the commonName when performing SSL certificate checks. If a remote attacker were able to perform man-in-the-middle attacks, this flaw could be exploited to eavesdrop on encrypted communications from Ruby applications using these protocols. ([CVE-2007-5770](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-5770))
