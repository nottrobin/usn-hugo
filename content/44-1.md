title: "USN-44-1&#58; perl information leak"
series: [ ubuntu-4.10]
date: 2004-12-21 12:00:00
description: |
    A race condition and possible information leak has been discovered in Perl&#39;s File::Path::rmtree(). This function changes the permission of files and directories before removing them to avoid problems with wrong permissions. However, they were made readable and writable not only for the owner, but for the entire world, which opened a race condition and a possible information leak (if the actual removal of a file/directory failed for some reason).
