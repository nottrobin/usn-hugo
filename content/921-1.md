A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 9.10

### Software description

* firefox-3.5 

* xulrunner-1.9.1 

### Details

Martijn Wargers, Josh Soref, Jesse Ruderman, and Ehsan Akhgari discovered flaws in the browser engine of Firefox. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-0174](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-0173">CVE-2010-0173</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-0174))

It was discovered that Firefox could be made to access previously freed memory. If a user were tricked into viewing a malicious website, a remote attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2010-0177](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-0175">CVE-2010-0175</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-0176">CVE-2010-0176</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-0177))

Paul Stone discovered that Firefox could be made to change a mouse click into a drag and drop event. If the user could be tricked into performing this action twice on a crafted website, an attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript with chrome privileges. ([CVE-2010-0178](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-0178))

It was discovered that the XMLHttpRequestSpy module as used by the Firebug add-on could be used to escalate privileges within the browser. If the user had the Firebug add-on installed and were tricked into viewing a malicious website, an attacker could potentially run arbitrary JavaScript. ([CVE-2010-0179](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-0179))

Henry Sudhof discovered that an image tag could be used as a redirect to a mailto: URL to launch an external mail handler. ([CVE-2010-0181](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-0181))

Wladimir Palant discovered that Firefox did not always perform security checks on XML content. An attacker could exploit this to bypass security policies to load certain resources. ([CVE-2010-0182](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2010-0182))
