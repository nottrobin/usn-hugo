    Maksymilian Arciemowicz reported that a flaw in the fnmatch() implementation in the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library could allow an attacker to cause a denial of service. This can be demonstrated in a remote denial of service attack against mod_autoindex in the Apache web server. ([CVE-2011-0419](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2011-0419))
