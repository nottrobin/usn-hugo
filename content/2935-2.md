### Details

USN-2935-1 fixed vulnerabilities in PAM. The updates contained a packaging change that prevented upgrades in certain multiarch environments. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that the PAM pam_userdb module incorrectly used a case-insensitive method when comparing hashed passwords. A local attacker could possibly use this issue to make brute force attacks easier. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. ([CVE-2015-3238](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-7041">CVE-2013-7041</a>) Sebastian Krahmer discovered that the PAM pam_timestamp module incorrectly performed filtering. A local attacker could use this issue to create arbitrary files, or possibly bypass authentication. This issue only affected Ubuntu 12.04 LTS and Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-2583">CVE-2014-2583</a>) Sebastien Macke discovered that the PAM pam_unix module incorrectly handled large passwords. A local attacker could possibly use this issue in certain environments to enumerate usernames or cause a denial of service. (<a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2015-3238))
