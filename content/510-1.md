### linux-source-2.6.20 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 7.04

### Software description

* linux-source-2.6.20 

### Details

A flaw was discovered in the PPP over Ethernet implementation. Local attackers could manipulate ioctls and cause kernel memory consumption leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-2525](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2525))

An integer underflow was discovered in the cpuset filesystem. If mounted, local attackers could obtain kernel memory using large file offsets while reading the tasks file. This could disclose sensitive data. ([CVE-2007-2875](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2875))

Vilmos Nebehaj discovered that the SCTP netfilter code did not correctly validate certain states. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted packet causing a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-2876](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2876))

Luca Tettamanti discovered a flaw in the VFAT compat ioctls on 64-bit systems. A local attacker could corrupt a kernel_dirent struct and cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-2878](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-2878))

A flaw in the sysfs_readdir function allowed a local user to cause a denial of service by dereferencing a NULL pointer. ([CVE-2007-3104](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-3104))

A buffer overflow was discovered in the random number generator. In environments with granular assignment of root privileges, a local attacker could gain additional privileges. ([CVE-2007-3105](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-3105))

A flaw was discovered in the usblcd driver. A local attacker could cause large amounts of kernel memory consumption, leading to a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-3513](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-3513))

Zhongling Wen discovered that the h323 conntrack handler did not correctly handle certain bitfields. A remote attacker could send a specially crafted packet and cause a denial of service. ([CVE-2007-3642](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-3642))

A flaw was discovered in the CIFS mount security checking. Remote attackers could spoof CIFS network traffic, which could lead a client to trust the connection. ([CVE-2007-3843](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-3843))

It was discovered that certain setuid-root processes did not correctly reset process death signal handlers. A local user could manipulate this to send signals to processes they would not normally have access to. ([CVE-2007-3848](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-3848))

The Direct Rendering Manager for the i915 driver could be made to write to arbitrary memory locations. An attacker with access to a running X11 session could send a specially crafted buffer and gain root privileges. ([CVE-2007-3851](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-3851))

It was discovered that the aacraid SCSI driver did not correctly check permissions on certain ioctls. A local attacker could cause a denial of service or gain privileges. ([CVE-2007-4308](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2007-4308))
