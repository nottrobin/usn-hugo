### mozilla-thunderbird, thunderbird vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 8.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 7.10
* Ubuntu 7.04
* Ubuntu 6.06 LTS

### Software description

* mozilla-thunderbird 

* thunderbird 

### Details

Various flaws were discovered in the browser engine. If a user had Javascript enabled and were tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could cause a denial of service via application crash, or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-2799](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2798">CVE-2008-2798</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2799))

It was discovered that Thunderbird would allow non-privileged XUL documents to load chrome scripts from the fastload file if Javascript was enabled. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary Javascript code with chrome privileges. ([CVE-2008-2802](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2802))

A flaw was discovered in Thunderbird that allowed overwriting trusted objects via mozIJSSubScriptLoader.loadSubScript(). If a user had Javascript enabled and was tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-2803](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2803))

Daniel Glazman found that an improperly encoded .properties file in an add-on can result in uninitialized memory being used. If a user were tricked into installing a malicious add-on, Thunderbird may be able to see data from other programs. ([CVE-2008-2807](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2807))

John G. Myers discovered a weakness in the trust model used by Thunderbird regarding alternate names on self-signed certificates. If a user were tricked into accepting a certificate containing alternate name entries, an attacker could impersonate another server. ([CVE-2008-2809](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2809))

A vulnerability was discovered in the block reflow code of Thunderbird. If a user enabled Javascript, this vulnerability could be used by an attacker to cause a denial of service via application crash, or execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-2811](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2811))

A flaw was discovered in the browser engine. A variable could be made to overflow causing Thunderbird to crash. If a user enable Javascript and was tricked into opening a malicious web page, an attacker could cause a denial of service or possibly execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2008-2785](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-2785))

Mozilla developers audited the MIME handling code looking for similar vulnerabilities to the previously fixed [CVE-2008-0304](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2008-0304), and changed several function calls to use safer versions of string routines. 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:
