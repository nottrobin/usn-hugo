    It was discovered that MoinMoin did not properly sanitize its input when processing Despam actions, resulting in cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. If a privileged wiki user were tricked into performing the Despam action on a page with a crafted title, a remote attacker could exploit this to execute JavaScript code.
