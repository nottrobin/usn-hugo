     A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel&#39;s KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem handles the CR4 control register at VM entry on Intel processors. A local host OS user can exploit this to cause a denial of service (kill arbitrary processes, or system disruption) by leveraging /dev/kvm access.

### linux vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux 

### Details

 A flaw was discovered in how the Linux kernel&#39;s KVM (Kernel Virtual Machine) subsystem handles the CR4 control register at VM entry on Intel processors. A local host OS user can exploit this to cause a denial of service (kill arbitrary processes, or system disruption) by leveraging /dev/kvm access. ([CVE-2014-3690](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-3690))

Don Bailey discovered a flaw in the LZO decompress algorithm used by the Linux kernel. An attacker could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (memory corruption or OOPS). ([CVE-2014-4608](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-4608))

Andy Lutomirski discovered a flaw in how the Linux kernel handles pivot_root when used with a chroot directory. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (mount-tree loop). ([CVE-2014-7970](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-7970))

Andy Lutomirski discovered that the Linux kernel was not checking the CAP_SYS_ADMIN when remounting filesystems to read-only. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (loss of writability). ([CVE-2014-7975](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2014-7975)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-40-lowlatency](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.13.0-40.69](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.13.0-40.69) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-40-powerpc64-emb](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.13.0-40.69](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.13.0-40.69) </span>

 : [linux-image-3.13.0-40-powerpc-e500mc](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.13.0-40.69](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.13.0-40.69) </span> 
 : [linux-image-3.13.0-40-powerpc64-smp](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux) <span> [3.13.0-40.69](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/3.13.0-40.69) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
