### Details

USN-850-1 fixed vulnerabilities in poppler. The security fix for [CVE-2009-3605](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2009-3605) introduced a regression that would cause certain applications, such as Okular, to segfault when opening certain PDF files.

This update fixes the problem. We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that poppler contained multiple security issues when parsing malformed PDF documents. If a user or automated system were tricked into opening a crafted PDF file, an attacker could cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code with privileges of the user invoking the program.
