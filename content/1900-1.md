### linux-ec2 vulnerabilities

A security issue affects these releases of Ubuntu and its derivatives:

* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in the kernel. 

### Software description

* linux-ec2 

### Details

 Dmitry Monakhov reported a race condition flaw the Linux ext4 filesystem that can expose stale data. An unprivileged user could exploit this flaw to cause an information leak. ([CVE-2012-4508](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4508))

Dave Jones discovered that the Linux kernel&#39;s socket subsystem does not correctly ensure the keepalive action is associated with a stream socket. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) by creating a raw socket. ([CVE-2012-6657](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-6657))

An information leak was discovered in the Linux kernel&#39;s tkill and tgkill system calls when used from compat processes. A local user could exploit this flaw to examine potentially sensitive kernel memory. ([CVE-2013-2141](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2141))

Kees Cook discovered a format string vulnerability in the Broadcom B43 wireless driver for the Linux kernel. A local user could exploit this flaw to gain administrative privileges. ([CVE-2013-2852](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2013-2852)) 

### Update instructions

The problem can be corrected by updating your system to the following package version:

Ubuntu 10.04 LTS
 : [linux-image-2.6.32-354-ec2](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2) <span> [2.6.32-354.67](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-ec2/2.6.32-354.67) </span> 

To update your system, please follow these instructions: [https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Security/Upgrades).

After a standard system update you need to reboot your computer to make all the necessary changes.

ATTENTION: Due to an unavoidable ABI change the kernel updates have been given a new version number, which requires you to recompile and reinstall all third party kernel modules you might have installed. If you use linux-restricted-modules, you have to update that package as well to get modules which work with the new kernel version. Unless you manually uninstalled the standard kernel metapackages (e.g. linux-generic, linux-server, linux-powerpc), a standard system upgrade will automatically perform this as well.
