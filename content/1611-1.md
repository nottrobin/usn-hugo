    Henrik Skupin, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Soroush Dalili and others discovered several memory corruption flaws in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, an attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the program.

* Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
* Ubuntu 11.10
* Ubuntu 11.04
* Ubuntu 10.04 LTS

### Summary

Several security issues were fixed in Thunderbird. 

### Software description

* thunderbird 

### Details

Henrik Skupin, Jesse Ruderman, Christian Holler, Soroush Dalili and others discovered several memory corruption flaws in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, an attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of another website or arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-4191](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3982">CVE-2012-3982</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3983">CVE-2012-3983</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3988">CVE-2012-3988</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3989">CVE-2012-3989</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4191))

David Bloom and Jordi Chancel discovered that Thunderbird did not always properly handle the &lt;select&gt; element. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could exploit this to conduct URL spoofing and clickjacking attacks. ([CVE-2012-3984](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3984))

Collin Jackson discovered that Thunderbird did not properly follow the HTML5 specification for document.domain behavior. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could exploit this to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via JavaScript execution. ([CVE-2012-3985](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3985))

Johnny Stenback discovered that Thunderbird did not properly perform security checks on test methods for DOMWindowUtils. ([CVE-2012-3986](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3986))

Alice White discovered that the security checks for GetProperty could be bypassed when using JSAPI. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted web page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-3991](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3991))

Mariusz Mlynski discovered a history state error in Thunderbird. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could exploit this to spoof the location property to inject script or intercept posted data. ([CVE-2012-3992](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3992))

Mariusz Mlynski and others discovered several flaws in Thunderbird that allowed a remote attacker to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. With cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, if a user were tricked into viewing a specially crafted page and had JavaScript enabled, a remote attacker could exploit these to modify the contents, or steal confidential data, within the same domain. ([CVE-2012-4184](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3993">CVE-2012-3993</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3994">CVE-2012-3994</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4184))

Abhishek Arya, Atte Kettunen and others discovered several memory flaws in Thunderbird when using the Address Sanitizer tool. If a user were tricked into opening a malicious website and had JavaScript enabled, an attacker could exploit these to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of another website or execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-4188](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3990">CVE-2012-3990</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-3995">CVE-2012-3995</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4179">CVE-2012-4179</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4180">CVE-2012-4180</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4181">CVE-2012-4181</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4182">CVE-2012-4182</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4183">CVE-2012-4183</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4185">CVE-2012-4185</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4186">CVE-2012-4186</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4187">CVE-2012-4187</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4188))

It was discovered that Thunderbird allowed improper access to the Location object. An attacker could exploit this to obtain sensitive information. Under certain circumstances, a remote attacker could use this vulnerability to potentially execute arbitrary code as the user invoking the program. ([CVE-2012-4193](http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4192">CVE-2012-4192</a>, <a href="http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2012-4193))
